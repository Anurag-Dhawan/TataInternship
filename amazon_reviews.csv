0,vasu a.,Beast in OnePlus.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Brilliant..I have uploaded some pics of selfie as well as Portrait shot of near by shot.What is loved is phone has very good sensor.It's my first phone after my job so it's really special for me.Fine Screen..Smooth touch..Camera is beast. Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it."
1,Amazon Customer,OnePlus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the  I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.
2,ATMANAND  SHARMA,Khoda pahad nikli chuihya,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Average phone from one plus but surprisingly very bad battery life though good battery on paper. Disappointed .
3,Amazon Customer,One plus Nord issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.
4,ARYA,'More than midrange but less than premium '.  This phone has heating issues...😥,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks"
5,Sibasish Raulo,Preorder customers were scammed,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I have nothing to say about this product but marketing strategy. While pre-ordering this product there was no hdfc bank creditcard offer so I have to purchase it by paying full amount. But after delivery it is showing hdfc credit card discount is applicable for 12gb + 256gb variant. This is ridiculous. There's not even return option for this product. This is not at all fair to the customer who pre-ordered this product. And OnePlus and Amazon is just breaking their trust.
6,Dinesh Kumar,Bed battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true
7,rishabh,"cheap camera, overpriced phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars,  don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.
8,Nitin Mittal,Empty mobile box with all.missomg contents was delivered,1.0 out of 5 stars,   Stop cheating customers by arranging a tempered delivery with only an empty mobile box. It's my hard earned money and the Amazon investigation team is refuting all claims.I have enough evidences to prove my claim of tempered delivery and will escalate the matter to the highest level and will also drag Amazon India on all social media besides suing them.in Consumer court.
9,Amazon Customer,Changed to Nord from 6t,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days."
10,Akhil,Best in it's range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.Update- The bug was fixed on the same day."
11,Saikrishna,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied"
12,Imran Khan,Packing was not good. Overall disappointed with product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.---------++++------After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi"
13,Bhanu,I don't like this.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First look is cool.But too much weight.Not easy in use.When you open some web page or other app ,you want to go back there is not easy option to go back.12gb ram is wasted because it's working like 6gb ram mobile.My heart saying that I return this product."
14,Manmohan Singh Tanwar,Auto call recorder not available,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Where is call recording option
15,Nidhin Cherian,For camera enthusiasts,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dear camera enthusiasts,Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera2. Lacks in sharp and crisp outputBetter go for OnePlus 7T"
16,pavan,"This is my initial impression after using OnePlus nord for few hours, as I received today",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was opted for exchange with my RedMi note 7 pro to purchase OnePlus nord 8GB modal.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Bloatware free and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro’s:• OxygenOS – gives very good user experience than other android mobiles.• 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display• Camera’s – image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera, nightscape, slow motion video and front camera• Stable video recording – with Optical and electronic image stabilization• Supports 5G network – I am not sure when it is going to be launched in India (may be in 2021.?)• Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – supports 5G network with midrange performance (excellent for daily usage)Cons:• Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output• Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBGI don’t find more cons as of nowColor tint issue?Not found in my mobile, while screen light dims less than 20%.If your priority is not gaming, this could be considerable option."
17,Amit,"Amazing phone, damaged packaging.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone 5/5Phone is fantastic, everything as expected.But the box was open. No seal on box. Though items are fine inside but might be duplicate as well. This is not a good exp for a prebooked phone.Box1/5"
18,aamir khan,Not satisfied,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really very disappointed with the performance, as battery is not so good, charging time is too late as given by the company, device display quality is also not good"
19,Anand,Oneplus has returned in its own market with a worthy product.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  First of all I wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as I want to gift it to my sister.Oneplus is a no match in this range.  You should go for this without any doubt.Except poor camera quality eveything is superb. Snapdragon 765G is fast and 90Hz display is superb. I am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported.One more low point is that it does not feel  premium as its side is made of plastic.Go for it without any second thought.I will edit my review after some days of use.
20,Savan,First And Worst Experience With OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Received A Faulty Device As First Only And Received The phone Where Speaker Was Not Working...
21,Sahil kalsi,Worth every penny & please don't buy Oppo Reno 4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming."
22,Abhishek,OnePlus NORD detailed review.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ...I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit ..I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons .Pros-1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent.2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good.3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone.4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate.5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie.6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone .7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price.Cons.1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865.2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion.3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this.Personal Opinion.Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.If you find this review helpful please consider to like this review"
23,shristi bhatt,Super hit,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In love with the camera quality and the color of the phone. Works smoothly. Impressed!!Also online sale is on 4th and I got it today (on 2nd). Swift delivery.
24,Dharanidharan.S.P,No issues and great phone with medium camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY."
25,SHYAM SINGH,Its a good set,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I always want a oneplus mobile now I have one it's a good mobile
26,Sai Kumar Thota,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Waste of money , Not at all satisfied ,poor camera quality , poor product quality. Better to buy Redmi mobile ..."
27,saisathvik,WORTH THE BUCKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,  First things first I'm very impressed by the AMAZON delivery services.Coming to NORD It got all the hype. Easily recommendable if you use it as a regular phone for social media and business purpose. It is not so great for gamers. So think before you buy it and compare all the other options too.Last things last overall performance is very fast and enjoying the OXYGEN OS.
28,Chaitali,One plus and plus...NORD !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now! My wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus :-)"
29,Sachin Jawade,Unexpected Delivery 🤘,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's delivered today (3rd August)Branding level improved.Some sticker in box.Mobile is lite weight.Color is extremely premium.Screen quality same as 7T.Let's wait for detail feedback hope it will good 👻💕
30,Jijo Paul,"Decent Mobile, but Genuinely Overhyped..",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!"
31,Rajamurugan L,How is it oneplus nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very bad experience don't buy this product, the mobile display lighting very dull compare with redmi Mobile's and mobile over heating and camera quality very worst, don't buy this product. If you want this mobile please reach out nearby oneplus showroom and use this mobile and if you satisfied then you buy this product. I'm very unsatisfied this product 😔😔😔😔😔"
32,Subhodeep Ghosh,Selfie camera is south. Rest everything goes north.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the worst front cameras in recent days. Apart from that, it's a deal at this price."
33,Ashish,Amazing beast from OnePlus!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!"
34,Hemendra R.,OnePlus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just received OnePlus Nord grey 256 gb variant and trust me guys it is just amazing,worth every rupees."
35,Ayush,Display issues and Delay in delivery,1.0 out of 5 stars,  1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon.
36,Ritesh S Rao,"Its a good product, just a little costly",4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone received today. Bought it for my mother. She seems to like it a lot. Software experience as expected is very smooth. No lags faced. Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad). The battery life is good (2 hrs of video and browsing and loss of ~11% battery) so expect it to last all day for sure.
37,Azhar javed,Bad phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  A bad phone Asked to return Refused to return No such phone is mentioned feeling bad
38,Prajwal,Premium buget....not flagship,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly a lot of reviews are towards the camera..... of course it's not flagship, for the price you're paying it's well worth it for a balanced experience......you can't expect it to be flagship in all levels.....if you want then buy a specific phone catered to that like rog for gaming.etc-Smooth fluidic screen movements-Fast performance 12gb ram-Decent camera with 4k feature-Speaker volume is loud and sound is clear"
39,Jackie Thakkar,Bad phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not value for money, you are spending 30K for one plus phone but they not providing same to u. For same feature you will get in 22K phone. Only plus point is in one plus is this is 5G ready and 12Gb 256 storage phone.I have shared some pictures of Oneplus and same i have click from 18K phone Real me 6 pro. And i feel Real Realme bttr phone compair to Oneplus."
40,Nirmit kapoor,Best in class,5.0 out of 5 stars,  First i was confused as review by Youtubers. But i can say this is best phone in this segment OnePlus oxygen OS is dam smooth with simple and clean UI.. Camera works excellent and don't go with hype of blue marble it look like realme types.. Grey color looks like Flagship OnePlus .. 50 minutes Full charging ... PUBG is working good ping is also decent while playing...
41,Harish T,Worst Experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display itself not working!!  Did not expect this from oneplus !!!!How did it pass QA and delivered to customer if the display itself not turning on ?????I got my mobile through pre booking and returned it. When i asked about replacement, they said there is no replacement stock eventhough regular stocks are on sale. Worst mobile buying experience ever !!!!!!!!!!"
42,Hardeep Singh,Smooth performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like that phone very much. It is smooth , good audio and video. I missed one thing here is no audio jack. Today is day one will update our review in 1-2 weeks.Day 26 here is my review . Phone is super smooth . first week I feel battery is dying to fast but there is an software which is now fixed with update now I am getting full day battery backup. I play pubg alot with no lags and frame drop. There is no issue with display like other people are saying about nord. My experience is awesome with this phone."

44,The wanderer,Review after using the mobile for one week,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure."
45,Atanu Mandal,Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My Nord Journey with Amazon:-15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499.18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers.28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999.05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start.Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon.** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone.Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use.Pros :✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10.✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back.(U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality).✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate.✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography.✓ Duel selfie camera.✓ Light weight and easy to grip.✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates.✓ Battery backup is quite good.✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment.✓ Both Sim working fine.✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z.

Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case.✓No Dolby Atmos.✓No 3.5 mm jack.## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro..."
46,Debraj Das,Worst camera even though having 4 of them,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got the mobile..1st impression - minimal design, no useless app, got the os update... But ! The camera ! Not statisfied.. currently I'm using Poco F1.. even though the Nord has quad rear cam with latest sensor, but the images are too grainy.. my Poco F1 produces much more better image..This is within 2hours review after having the product.. I'll update further after using it sometimes.."
47,Chetanya,Bugs,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice phone but the green tint issue is very noticeable on 50 percente brightness and is annoying the why 2 stars. Rest of good. Also photos in artificial light give a very pale colour to skin
48,Sudhir Babu G,Regarding camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are buying for camera, then my suggestion is don't buy this phone because compared to one plus 6, photos are getting blured in Nord."
49,Prudhvi,Display color leak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pre ordered and waited like anything... Arrived on time. Everything is fantastic in Nord except Display color leak or I don't know what to call it. I shared images and videos, go through it. Why why why faulty products?"
50,suman saurabh ghosh,"heating issues , Battery draining !! NO return policy for defective product.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  While charging, Video calling , simple Net browsing (separately)There is no Return/Replace policy for defective products as inspection guy says Amazon will fetch money from his pocket if he allows replacement and amazon is not satisfied with the issue...So indirectly no one will take risk to approve these internal issue as they are afraid what if amazon doesnt get satisfied .. like how i was not able to satisfy the inspection guy.. its all about inspection guys wish .. if he wants then only your issue will get resolved ..else you have to live with the defective product."
51,Saherr,Please return money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst phone
52,Nensee Kaneriya,Display issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display tint issue in my modelAmazon refused to replace my phone.
53,Ayanik Dey,Very very disappointed with amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I was totally devastated after i received the product as it was a defective one. Its getting hanged and switched off multiple times automatically. And after all these stuff i dont kno whether my product will be replaced. Very very  poor from amazon.
54,ayush joshi,This phone is just amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)"
55,Sasank P,Absolutely recommend this phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Almost everything you get under 30k price range... Oxygen OS is the best android skin right now... Experiencing it under 30k is a deal breaker...There are other smartphones with Snapdragon 800 series processors under 30k.. but not all of them are bloatware free except OnePlus...Buy this phone if you love to have a nice UI, great display, good camerasAbsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under 30kProvding a headphone jack to type-c  would have been very good"
56,Abhijeet Anand,An honest an Fair review after using it for a while.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-•OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.•The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.•The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)•The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)•The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.•The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-•The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.•After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone"
57,Rahul,Balanced Device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using it for several days,I noticed some issues1) Image processing is taking time(more than usual)2) After clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while, otherwise the image will get blurred3) Low light photography is very poor4) Battery is draining faster even in 60Hz refresh rate.5) Sometimes networks drops are there, you'll lost internet connection for seconds and it'll restore after it.But all of these issues can be resolved by update and OnePlus is very concerned about their customers,as they keeps asking for issues in their community page.Buy it if you're not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device."
58,SHIVAM AGARWALA,BAD EXPERIENCE,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Poor display ... .. also vibration slider not working properly ....Bad experience.. OP
59,Dilbagh Singh,Not good,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is ok but some drawback..
60,surya prakash,Very bad performance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very very bad performance , i upgrade to my mi a1 that was brilliant Mobile the one plus Nord is bad performance and camera fully unclear photos front and rear camera also"
61,Ravi Kumar,Very bad as expected,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst product
62,Mani Shankar,If you care about what the phone is than the specs...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.
63,Rahul,Nothing great about this mobile,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media.  The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just  mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.Felt so damn cheated.To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it."
64,Sandeep rana,Not good Colur,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bed product and performance no return policy not happy to this product
65,Amazon Customer,After 3 days usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out."
66,Sunil,Severe display issue (over brightened and green tint),1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have got severe display issue with green tint on 75% of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side. No matter how good the phone is in other features but it's being a mid range premium phone, at least this issue not expected.I have ordered 2 phones in which 1 phone is completely alright (no display issue) and other has severe. I tried to exchange the product but Amazon is not supporting for the same.EDIT : Thanks to Amazon for processing the return with refund. (Replacement could not be processed as the product is unavailable)"
67,Harshita,Not happy with the product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Returning window of this product is closed on 30-Aug and same day I started receiving problem in keyboard.Keyboard of Nord is crashing and I reached out to One Plus support team as well, ticket is open now n yet to be solved.But it is very disappointing to receive problem in newly bought product.After a bit research I found keyboard problem is occured in many of earlier One Plus mobiles. Battery is also draining within a day. 100% charged battery doesn't last for 2 days even.Recommend all the upcoming buyers to check their mobile as early as they can; specially the keyboard thing; within the returnable timeframe.My experience started with a sad note :("

71,Mohammed Ismail,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very exciting to buy this mobile. But later realized that it's not worth the money.Pros:*Oxygen OS*90hz refreshing display*Smooth operationCons:Poor battery backupUnexpected poor cameraLess color variantsBottomline: Expected much better product especially camera and battery but it lags both. Realme X2 pro is better option than this.Updated:It's a total waste off money, pls don't buy it, lot of issues are there in mobile.Calls are not hearing properly most of the time.Battery backup is very very poorCamera is totally awful, it's like 10000rs mobile, not worth for 30K."
72,Dattej Naik,Total disappointment with product and services,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Im a one plus user for past few years and this is the worst product iv seen.. the pros of this is its vibrant colour and price..Cons. Had problem with fingerprint sensor, its not water proof. As after 15 days of use moisture started forming inside both the camera lens.So i tried to aproach one plus customer care for conrinuous 3 days and it was so hectic stil they cudnt connect me to any customer executive of theirs. Then i aproached the customer care of one plus near me.. i.e. in mapusa goa. They said tht one plis is not providing them any support so they have shut down al the services temporarily.This is the first time i faced so much issues with the phone and one plus services..The only option left now is to throw this phone into garbage.. and go for some other phone .Totaly disapointed."
73,Ronit,Defective product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Tint issue.The dnd slider is malfunctioning.
74,GP,Screen has bands/strips of green and pink,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Generally i don't write negative feedback. But this phone really has screen issue. The screen reflects in bands of green and pink. This is mainly visible in white backgrounds. It stains eyes. What you return this phone.
75,SDanda,"Awesome processor power, Touch feel and Front Camera Quality",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models."
76,Parimal Chaudhari,Amazon User,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's best product...OnePlus is a brand and...Nord is a new direction...camera quality is better but not as good as 8...and battery life is quite good and it's charges 40 min 0 to 100....it gaves the best performance....and here is 90hrtz refresh rate then it's best but...if u used 60htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference... Face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good...and AMOLED display is the best... U must need to but this product....and now new direction comes in my life I m happy to get it..😋😋
77,Shalu Shaji,Descent phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I am writing this review after 1 day of use. First of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between 65-75 minutes.Camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography.Low light photography is the place we need to improve I believe.Sometimes I think this phone is overpriced but the Oxygen OS experience will remove that thinking from our mind.
78,Yaswanth S.,Well balanced package at a price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G."
79,Ryanrazor1911,Great Phone for works great.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone is perfect for someone who uses it for casual use like facebook WhatsApp and some games and other apps and nothing intensive and with some pictures here and there..Built wise: 8/10Camera: 7/10Speakers 7/10Display 9/10 (mine had no tint issue)Battery 6/10 could be optimised with updateSo if you are not a very heavy user than just go for it..phone feels very good in hand with a perfect weight balance... although pubg runs fine with smooth ultra but I played only 1 TDM XD.
80,arun,Disappointed with OnePlus cheep publicity tricks,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mobile overall ok, but I'm really disappointed with OnePlus cheep publishing stunts for both budget tv and phone, that's the reason for one star review. Camara is flicking when we take vedios of fire/ smoke, I took videos/pics on house warming all of them I took while yagnam were flicking and blure, OnePlus connect is not so usefull with the OnePlus TV, keyboard not opening, when we play vedio audio and video are nonsync. Front cam also not soo good, I like the fingrt print point and switch. They could have give option to the user for wired headset, cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours, don't think soo wireless ones will serve purpose."
81,Sanan Kamthe,A perfect smartphone for all of my needs!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!
82,Kindle Customer,A Midrange Phone With Best Camera Possible + Oxygen Os,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought the OnePlus phone first time and I bought12gb 256gb varient of this phone..I like every things on this smartphone like 5g ready, camera, oxygen os, performance is mediocore.The Software of this device is best in the game. I like it because it has the functionality like stock Android and also highly customisable. You can get software updates very quickly and fastly. It's 90hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy.I actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me. It's camera have OIS supported , you can get very good daytime shots with it. And may be mediocore night time shots But not as the level of flagship but this doesn't bother me because with the power of Lightroom I can bring those photos to the another level.The two things I didn't like that it's battery life it could be little bit better and also. It's display have some little tint issue.But that's not a big problem for me.Below are the attached sample shots from this device."
83,Jas,A daily driver,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star."
84,Chinmayee Mishra,"A delightful device, held back by quality control",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it."
85,SourabhHalder007,A phone and brand you can trust!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone got delivered today, it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder. I bought this phone for my father and playing around with it I guess this would be the best option for him. He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks. Macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of.NOTE: Heavy Gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term.Thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion, a good strategy must say."

87,Arki,Serious issues with Bluetooth connectivity (solved with updates),4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well what do you know, after much anticipation, I finally received my oneplus nord. thanks to amazon for striving to deliver even during these trying times.without much further ado lets get down to the nitty-gritty as am not much into writing reviews.First of all gave only three stars as it is kinda hit and miss.> Battery is ok with average usage but heavy users will be disappointed... wrap charge does a wonderful job as described and charges the device really fast.>Camera is so so .... 48 mp takes good shots but that's about it as the rest is average at best ..macro is the worst.>Finger print scanner and face unlock works just fine.>Had no issues with display. videos are crisp... youtube and netflix videos especially hdr contents are a joy to watch.> wifi and internet connectivity is good especiall with dual connect.>Microphone quality is ok and cell reception is also good.Thats the ok part ... now comes some of the bad part> As in the headlines there are some serious issues with bluetooth connectivity, All bluetooth devices you name it... fit bit, audio etc etc  gets disconneted frequently as well as sometimes it is a pain to pair sometimes not pairing at all, have tried the bluetooth devices in other phones and laptop and they work just fine.. why am I making this a big thing...... because one plus did not include a headphone jack period and i love listening to music!!!! i dont know whether this is a software or hardware issue ... have installed the latest updates so will have to wait for the next update to know whether it will get corrected or not.>The speakers on the phone are mediocrewill update after using it for a month or so (hopefully my impression of the device will change... keeping fingers crossed)Now you choose whether to buy or not as there are other good phones out there.>overall performance is good (not excellent)Update:Bluetooth issues solved with updates, amazed at OnePlus frequent updates, camera performing much better now, have been using the phone for about a month now.4 stars"
88,MVK,No issues any more as we heard...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All rumours like green tint , display issue at low light condition , battery backup is less , takes more time to charge were absolutely WRONG.OnePlus lovers can go for it without any second thought.Tested almost 10days to give exact review...Display is good., 90Hz refresh rate is awesome, no tint issue at all brighness levels, loudness of speaker is good (no stereo), charges less than an hour(warp charging), good battery backup almost a day (without gaming) .Only issue I faced is with OnePlus z series bluetooth headset gets disconnected in between calls and audio playback. Hope this will also resolve soon."
89,Rahul Banga,OnePlus Nord turned out to be a dudd!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry."
90,Roopa C N,The best phone (for the price),5.0 out of 5 stars,  An awesome phone for the price. Simply great. The camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos. If you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto 30k go for it. No other brand gives you a 12|256 variant for this price. The phone is awesome. You wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using.
91,karanjit k.,camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The front camera is pathetic, blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures, its not worth giving 28k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone. For front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad, sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality. i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it, or they just want to bluff the customer by name......... u can get more good camera phone in this rangeRear camera is good, macro is pathetic its like vga camera, in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality, you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos.Battery drains too quicklySoftware is good"
92,Ganesh Vishwakarma,"Bad camera, overall good!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is good but few things disappointed me. Please see the following matrix given below:1. Build quality: 4.5/5 ( it does not have the metal frame)2. Display: 4/5 ( compared with samsung j6 AMOLED display, it is not up to the mark, i liked the Samsung's display because of color reproduction and quality)3. Battery: 4/54. Operating System: 5/55. Camera: 2.5/5 ( eventhough it has 48 MP with Quad Cam setup, pictures are not detailed, it a average camera even after the software update; specially 2MP macro lens sucks; video quality is very nice; camera app user experience is not exciting.6. Processor: 4/5 (because its futuristic 5G)"
93,guddu kumar,Speaker volume goes down day by day automatically.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  When the phone was delivered it’s sound looks good.But after a days it’s speaker volume automatically goes low .And day by day it’s going low and low.Even on handsfree mode on full volume I have to take it to close to my ear to hear it.I want to replace it but amazon not allowing for replacement.I am totally frustrated after buy this phone.
94,Kamal,Doesn't go with the price tag,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its been one month approx of purchasing this device in which OnePlus has given 5 updates so here is my review after one month usage and on latest update1) the mobile is full of bugs, it looks like oneplus team didn't tested it before launching . A lot of bugs like camera crashing, photos not showing in gallery ,overheating after only 25min streaming,night mode error . already shared logs with the OnePlus team no fix as of now even after 5 updates still the same problems2)  on an average only 5 hours of screen on time, doesn't look like 4000mah battery have to charge twice during a day ,my older redmi Mobile was giving better SOT than this3)  network drops issue most often chrome shows blank page have to reload 3-4 times to show the page content4) the oxygen os is good smooth as silk5) camera performance is average6) amoled display surely surpasses lcd ,great colors diversification Conclusion- being new member to OnePlus community i expected premium services didn't expect such a buggy device"
95,Ayyappan,No Tint issue ... It's been fixed 😊👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  NO TINT ISSUEI TURNED ONT HE PHONE THEY GAVE ME AN UPDATE...SO typically your phone brightness level0 - 100 levelthey palyed it smart .. they removed 0--50 levelsSo technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to 0.. well it's actually 50th level portraying as 0 .. My First costly Smart phone.Well.. For average person I mostly invest under 15k for a smart phone.. Now I'm in work from home and I need a phone which has a fast performance to toggle between apps for my communication / multitasking without any lagging or unwanted adds... And ya bla bla people who worship camera as if they are Ravi varmans cousin's...  Guys this phone is literally a mustang coated in Ferrari dust...*Hard build even though claims to be plastic body* A devil Performance which u can expect from no  Android phone.* Yes fast charging helps us stay alive.*It has a open ""allow access"" system which I like so that I can monitor which app is using my phone tools..* When smart phone concept came to the marked I started with Samsung Galaxy pop moved to Moto G then redmi 4 ... Now it's NORD...I bought it @ 25k by exchanging my redmi 4.. a decent buy for me.Rating:Back camera:5/5Front camera:4/5 because pics look slightly animatedPerformance: 5/5Battery:4/5 you can expext 6-7hrs max.. but fast charging helps u in 30-45mins charge sets full battery..Design: 5/5Durability : No IP certification so try to avoid water drops and dust touching the device.People buying this in Chennai .. remember only one service center available... Tnagar..I recommend you to use the back case given buy them ..it's durabale."
96,Sangeeth,Best smartphone under 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have used it for about a week and I will have to tell that it's the Best allround smartphone under 30k. You are getting future ready with a 5g smartphone and Brand Recognition of One plus.Pros1) Oxygen OS2) 90Hz Amoled screen3) Smooth performance4) Good Battery Life5) Fast ChargingThere are not many cons according to me. The only one I which i noticed is that Rear camera quality isn't that great compared to Oneplus 8 like they are claiming. But they are good in Ample lighting conditions. Only when it comes to Indoor and low light they struggle a bit.Verdict- Go for it. It's a perfectely well balanced phone covering every aspects. The beauty of OXYGEN OS and Brand Recognition of ONE PLUS are something that you can't ignore.
97,Padma,Very horrible phone  a big no 👎,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very worst phone don't buy.Iam facing network connection issues.while talking it is going into hold n recording starts automatically . whatsapp call not at all responding very very worst phone after few updates iam facing these problems ...one month after iam giving my feedback don't buy this phone waste of money ..
98,Arjun goyal,Combines lot of good elements in one affordable package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don’t mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You’d be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback... So if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than 30k then just go for it"
99,Shubham,Not recommend,3.0 out of 5 stars,  * Packing - Soft (Amazon)* Price - 25999 (AE Discount)* Touch - very smooth* Camera - front not good very disappointed by OnePlusBack - need improvement like filters and autofocus* Have some bugs* Purchase advise - Think again

101,Adnan Ali,My honest review,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all I'm writing this review after 3-4 days of use. 1.The display is indeed a bliss to look at. You may not notice it at first. But you'll see other phones in slow motion when you use other phones.2.The warp charging is amazing. Gets your phone filled in under an hour.3.The primary camera is nice and captures details but it lacks the natural colour reproduction at times and the dynamic range needs to be better.(the camera of the redmi k20 pro is slightly better in terms of the color reproduction) and iphone xr camera still is better4.The macro camera is bullshit and need updates right away.5. Wide angle lens is okay, just okay.needs betterment. And could be better.6.The selfie camera is fine but no iphone camera , the wide angle selfie isn't that nice7.the build quality is firm,nice and of nice built but stands a tad bit lower from the redmi k20 pro ,maybe because of the metal frame vs plastic in Nord.8.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is damn fast.9. The battery lasts for a day under moderate use. Not more than a day for sure.10.Oxygen OS ! Wow . Just smooth, fast and a bliss !"
102,Vivek,Nord is good but need to develop camera quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I had used my oneplus nord for 3hoursPros1.regarding display display was really cool with 90refresh rate and smooth2. Oxygen os is love3.I didn't find any greentits issues in my oneplus nors4.battery i was charged to 100% within 35mins where inital charges was 51% fast charging5.Audio clarity really good and no lagging and no network issues foundCons1.avg of camera quality and nightspace and bad not perfect2.this mobile is not for gaming they are really better choice rather than thisOverallIf your are daily user without gaming it is good
103,Amazon Customer,Good phone for day to day usage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display/Touch is really good.Battery Life is also good for normal users like me, who use 3-4 hrs screen time in a day.. I am easily able to draw 40-42 hrs with a full charge.Camera is good..though it can be improved.Real quick charging.Fingerprint reader is fast, with lots of customization.You will see lot of new features when you switch from an android phone like - App drawer, hidden apps, wifi+ mobile data mode etc.."
104,Anupama,Overall a really good phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been us this phone for a week now and here is my review.The build quality is quite good but I don’t like the plastic frame but feels durable enough.Look wise the phone is gorgeous and eye catchy I loved its look and in-hand feel.The rear camera is quite nice for the wide angle camera struggles in low light and the selfie camera is only good in well lighted conditions and is useless at night or even little dark. I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won’t notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements
105,Tejas Ravindra Haramkar,"Cool, neat and clean, smooth....",5.0 out of 5 stars,  Thank you OnePlus and Amazon... Product delivery is very fast.. I am first time using OnePlus device....but I love it...😘😘😘
106,Nishant Rajkumar,Worst Product experience of my life!! BUYERS BEWARE,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had ordered a OnePlus Nord from Amazon on 6th of August. It was delivered on 8th of August. After using it for a week the display was distorted. I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution. I will never buy a OnePlus device ever again till I exist."
107,Amazon Customer,very poor camera and call issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  what happened to oneplus. It used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x. now we no longer can trust specs on paper.selfie camera is one of the worst ever. blurry pixelated images. 3 yrs old phone models in this range have better camera. even making calls have issues with this phone. there are bugs everywhere.very poor quality in ever aspect. total waste of money. they have to understand, they cant please everyone. End of the quality matters and there should be value for money spent and specs needs to be up to the industry standard. just saying 32 MP is not enough, if it performs equivalent to 5MP.this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money."
108,ChatakonduYaswanth,Not recommended please........,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Just ok mobile there are lot more defects but manageable for normal users my suggestion to go with other brand's in this price# Black bar in night mode at top if display# Screen tint issue pucca# No Battery backup# Worst cam no use of back 2 cameras# No full screen mode for applications# No 3.5 Jack# Out of the box RAM 4gb/8gb# Sound us loud but no clear# Original accessories are so costly# More baground cached data# Sometimes lagging..Overall my rating is 4/10 please check all YouTube pros and cons before you buy don't buy in hurry like me.
109,Saif Alam Khan,Great phone by OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Premium looking phone with a clean and smooth UI. With regular and faster updates by OP, it's certainly the best phone in this price range."
110,Suganraj,Never settle - Too Many  issues to be settled with Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  #Camera Quality is not up to the mark when compared to  previous OnePlus previous models and generates lots of noise.#Bugs were there when I did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of 4K@60 fps and it got resolved once I updated to the latest OS version.#Green & Purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below 30% brightness.#People who prefer 6GB + 64 GB variant must keep in mind that OnePlus Nord does not have an expandable memory slot. So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue."
111,Priya Kumar,Didn’t expect this from ONEPLUS,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finger print reader is too slow and asking me to keep my fingers for more time than other phones.. battery life I have no idea.. I haven’t started using it fully,. Camer quality.. sorry there is no quality at all.. too much of beautification In the front camera and back camera too.. I can’t even make a video call using this because I don’t look like me in the front camera.. am really really disappointed.. am using iPhone 7+ should have gone for iphone 11.. I did a big mistake.. since it’s not refundable I have to live with the regret 💔 until I upgrade next.. thanks n bye"
112,Shishir,Excellent purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After using 3 years the battery of my  moto x4 is suddenly stopped working after an ota update .... battery replacement was not possible during lockdown ....at the same time one plus announced to release a midrange smartphone like zlite ....one plus brand has great customer satisfaction regarding oxygen os optimization on hardware  ..so I decided to purchase oneplus nord (later declared) with preorder benefits ....blindly purchase Rs 499 ... enjoyed AR launched event ..got my preorder box1  tshirt and stickers...booked nord @Rs 26k using amex card ..my pre-order is being delayed ..again oneplus announced that they will provide one year extra warrenty to those whose pre-order shiioed after 4aug ..mine shipped on 10 aug ... delivered on 11 aug ....also they also provide my box 2 @Rs4780 and provide one year extra warrenty as they promised.. so at last faith on oneplus regarding products offers is totally worthy...in this way effective price of my nord is 19620 [28k - 2k (amex offer) - 4780( gift box) -1599( one year extended warranty)].Right now I have updated my nord to 10.5.5 ..I didn't face any problem just one google discover issue which may be issue with Google dearch to higher refresh rate display ...No Bluetooth issueNo battery backup issue (since I am not a gamer)Fabulous display with 90hzFast 30 watt charger765G  ...5G readyBut have slightly tint screen issue (using dark theme and very low brightness)Camera is overhyped...may be optimised after ota update...Battery backup not at the best..
113,Amazon Customer,"Great midrange '5G' phone, performance at par with Flagships!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Read this review before buying OnePlus Nord!!!Review after using the phone for 9 days!Pro's:-1. Oxygen Os best os after 'ios'!2. Display is good! (Fluid Amoled 90hz)3. The speaker is loud and clear!4. Alert slider comes in handy!5. The phone is really good to hold!6. Warp charger!7. Future proof with '5g'8. Updates9. The camera quality is good both front and back after the update!10. Battery life is good for non-gamers!11. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock works really well!!Con's:-1. Amazon's delivery got the phone delivered after 2 weeks!2. No headphone jack,but understandable given that tws is the future!!3. Tint issue though not a major problem but can be seen in dark conditions!The phone is good, but I would advise you to wait for Realme x7 pro and Poco's nord killer, compare them with Nord before you take your decision!!Have a good day!!!😄"
114,B.Kumar,Nice 5 g phone in reasonable price in this segment,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice 5g phonePros -5 stars for battery, voice, sound.5 stars for screen colours and touch etc.4 stars for camera being limited features.Cons -1. During updates screen looks whole black, like something wrong with phone screen.2. No sd card provision.Cautions -Do not use backside transparent guards for this mobile as all guards available are flat but mobile is slightly curved from margins. So do not waste your money on backside guards.Overall -Nice mobile , Go for it"
115,SkReddy,OnePuls Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got mobile yesterday with pre-booking facility on Amazon,Super mobile with Flagship mobile specifications under 30000..1.Google dailer2.Battery3.camera4 OnePlus Brand"
116,Harry John,Absolute Gem....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had been a critic of one plus and it's users so far, but now realised why one plus users are so mad about their phones...till now I had used motorola, Sony and Samsung phones....never experienced the smoothness and speed like one plus....battery back up is absolutely good using it from 100% (8 pm to 9 am ) and had done all installing process, video and movie watching, still have 40% left.... absolutely stylish mobile, the blue colour  is damn attractive....I am not a gamer so have no idea in that side.... everybody had lot of praising for os....have to experience it and feel the smoothness....the only down side in this mobile is the large cut out for front camera, too big and one camera would be more than enough, it had also reduced the beauty of the phone....I had switched from Samsung A51 ( used it for less than 15 days), compared to Samsung the camera is far ahead....no colour tinting issue(worried a lot about it after ordering)....one more thing if u r using the case coming with the mobile be ready for a very bad smell from the case...my conclusion is blindly go for it, you will never regret....value for money...."
117,McK,Value for money mid ranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great battery life- I have consistently been getting a full day’s use on a single charge, even 36hrs on one occasion where I used it sparingly. And the battery charges 15% to 100% in under an hour.Display- Very good resolution, the high refresh rate helps tooSmooth app handling and multitasking- even in my 8GB ram variantAudio - very nice driver range and playback quality (sounds perfectly good on good headphones and earphones)"
118,Tapan Rout,Best in the price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After one day usage, I can say this is a very good mid range phone.Pros: smooth OS, Amoled screen quality is very good, no screen tint issues.No bloatware apps like other Chinese phones.Selfie camera is goodGood build quality.Face unlock is very fast.There are 6-10 tips and tricks available in Oxygen OS which is very useful in daily usage.Cons:Rear camera does decent job, not meeting the expectation set by OnePlus.Battery drains fast whenever refresh rate is set to 90Hz.On screen fingerprint scanner is not quick compared to rear scanner.Headphone jack is not a problem for me, I am using bluetooth earbuds. Also there are type c to 3.5mm converter available in the market in 200rupees.This Mobile is  very good choice for daily normal usage. Not recommended for heavy usage."
119,Michael A Jordan,There is no better phone in this price range.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had the OnePlus 3T before I went for the Nord. I had bought the 3T for 35k and bought this 12gb variant for 30k and I have to say, it's a HUGE upgrade for me.People in the reviews keep on commenting about how the camera isn't good, while comparing it to phones outsidebita price range. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, the cameras are excellent! The only phone that may be slightly better in the camera division maybe the Samsung A51 of a similar price range. But then again, the rest of the hardware in the A51 is pretty much garbage.The battery is excellent, touch response is excellent, gaming performance is good, not the best, but good enough (not for high perfomance gaming). I play COD on it on medium graphics and works very very smoothly. The display is just magnificent.If you are looking for a phone within 30k, your search stops here."
120,Suhel,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system."
121,Moinak,Best premium midranger in this price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the 12/256 version for 28k because of amex card. Best in this price I would say.Using this phone for more than 10 days now.Almost everything about this phone is best in this price.Processor: Works really well for day to day usage and any of the modern games. It won't lag or anything with 12gb ram.Display: you won't be disappointed at all. The best in this price. Nice amoled display, nice color and everything and 90Hz on top is like the best thing. Super smooth display.Camera: main rear camera is really good captures really good picture and low light photos r also good. Macro cam I don't think is that good, gets the job done. You can additionally use Gcam also if u want.But I Didn't like the selfie camera in low light, idk what the problem is but I guess with update they will fix it. Hopefully.Battery: Nice battery backup I would say. Gives about 7 hours of screen on time with moderate usage (including little gaming).And about charging speed, 0-100% in 55 minutes if you switch off and charge. And if it's on then it takes about 70 min to charge fully.Look and feel: Really looks good, I have the grey color which really suits. Premium glass back feels really light and premium.Speaker- no dual speaker or dolby atmos, but believe me the sound is really loud and clear. Actually better than other dual speaker phones.Cons- No 3.5mm audio jack and plastic frame.Conclusion- If u don't need the audio jack then I think this is the best buy in this price. You get brand value and oxygen OS with soo many other pros. Go with it without a second thought.Happy shopping 😊"
122,KAUSIK T.,Worst Camera Quality...!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is very disappointing...even Samsung's below 20k models will take good photos. Don't get trapped by their hypes & Gimmicks...!!! Pls do watch Geekayranjith's Detailed review video before you order it. Worst thing is depth camera is fake,it's useless. If u want to own OnePlus go for other good models,don't go for NORD...!!! Instead buying it for 30k..u can prefer other brands with better overall performance under 20-25k."
123,AFFAN MOHAMED,OVERRATED MOBILE FOR THIS PERFORMANCE,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Recived on 8th August. High rated mobile for this specs.

126,Ishdeep ,Overall a very good phone by OnePlus in this segment.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good, though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from 0 to 100% in over an hour (depending on the voltage you receive ). Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update."
127,Kunal Modhe,Awesome phone with some fixable flaws!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is one of the best phones from OnePlus buf with some fixable flaws. I'm using a 12GB RAM variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os's ram management. Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly. Everyone is saying battery is great but I didn't get more than 5hours of sot that too without gaming. Final call is yours, cheers!P.s. you can not uninstall the pre-installed Netflix app."
128,Mohammad Nowmaan,Good but not great.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Timely delivered. Overall satisfied with performance but camera is not upto the mark not a camera phone at all.
129,arun,Display quality is not good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display quality is not as good, coming from the oneplus5, the amoled of Oneplus5 is far better. Color is not same and saturation is also not good. I think it's really cheap display.I didn't notice any green tint issue."
130,faizal,Display tint issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display tint issue is there. Display turns pink and green on low brightness in dark mode.
131,Hardik bhansali,Filled with software and hardware bugs! Tread clear of it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too many bugs in the software. Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!"
132,Sudhir Kumar,Perfect mid range mobile for Indian market!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Surely the hype was worth it and so was the wait!!Pros- Display, Performance, In-display fingerprint, Premium feelCons- Mono speaker, Not so effective macro cameraBut ignore the cons and just get the device as no other mobile can compete with 12/256GB model in this range."
133,Dilip kr. Ghara,Balanced phone under 30K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Positive:1. Good display and touch (Pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience)2. Decent sound on both speaker and earphones3. Main camera (48MP) is good4. Brilliant RAM management, No lag observed in normal usage5. Satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly6. No heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging7. Finger print and face unlock works perfectly8. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard9. Blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great. In hand feeling is good.10. The clean and add free UI of the oxigen OS will make it way different from other android phone of this budget11. Back cover is really good. No complain on the pre-applied screen guard12. Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI"
134,Partha Bhowmik,Not the best but more than average mid range phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Though it has a screen issue in low brightness but overall good device.In low light if the screen brightness is set in low then there is a black bar through the camera cutout and also has slightly greenish tint.But in regular usage it doesn't make any effect.Overall good battery in regular usage and performance is also good enough.Thanks to oxygen .....is for smooth experience.NB. Cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue. Though it has 90 hz refresh rate but some times it lags. Need to fix this minor problems.
135,Bhuvanesh Rajan,"""Nord"" A good phone under 30k segment",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Oneplus Nord... I have been using this phone since 10 August 2020 and now it's a 15 days of usage review.This phone got a lot of hypes and I think it's all worth it... If someone planning to go from 15k phone user to under 30k segment this phone is a great one for you.1. So coming to the design aspect this phone is gorgeous, don't confuse yourself by the plastic frame and all use a bumper case.2. Battery life.. Is kind of decent and I won't say it's a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it's pretty decent.3. Camera, here it's the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don't worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can't what's in the screen. Since it's 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn't look soo big and it's handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it's even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It's the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is ""no green tint"" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don't think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful."
136,Ansh,"Pathetic , worst product , waste of money as per quality",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pathetic product from oneplus , and more to add in bad experience  there pathetic customer supportBrought it and within a week it shows *Qualcomm crashdump mode*Customer supports answers after 20,30 mins and asks for problem and then put on hold for another 30 minsNo where to report issue and ask for helpInstead I would have bought 9k mobile ,that works at least for year with decent  customer  service"
137,Wasif,This phone has serious Network issues!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beware !!Oneplus nord has serious network issues.Dual VOLTE is not always working. I am not able to recieve calls. I tried with Jio sim on both slots. Even tried using idea sim on one slot with 2g network. Tried different combinations; changing primary and secondary sim's. Ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software (or hardware?) and to solve this temporarily, i am now switching on/off airplane mode every now an then. Annoying!!! I've notified this in the oneplus community forum. For more information regarding this issue, search ""Oneplus nord network issues"" in google."
138,sandeep kumar,not much as expected but..!!! its cool in this budget.. go for it,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  today i got the mobile 12+256 . delivery was delay for one day , received all in good condition.just one look it great from outside  .pros :- continue used 1 hour its little bit heat , i dont know why its happening ???? :- front camera not as reality pic it seems to add some filter app.:- there is no audio jack or rear camera quality also not too much good as expected before .:- battery drain 8% used 1 hour continue . Cons:- screen is very good as faster .:- fingerprint  & face sensor  very quick  .:-fast charging:- its look slim phone as compared to other mobile like redmi, oppo, vivo etc.:- go for it in this budget will be update the reviews  after using few days.if you wana purchase oneplus nord then go for it ... its great phone in this budget ."
139,Subhadip Chatterjee,Good1,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Lovely phone..people who are talking about bad camera quality.. must be shooting in auto mode.. the pro mode if handled properly works like a breeze n the picture quality is also fantastic. n one always insatl GCAM to improve camera performance. yes the macro cam is useless. n i think with few updates the auto mode will also work fine. the display is vibrant.. its smpoth with 90hrz refresh rate. the only thing that is bothering me is the in box back cover.. as i use gesture to navigate the phone the edge of the cover is too pronounced.. hence not been able to navigate smoothly. waiting for other cool back cover options to hit the market.
140,VIVEKACHANDIRAN R,Good Mobile for Daily usage..But not best for Pro users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good mobile but not the best..oly primay 48MP lens performs well others are just a gimmick.Selfie cam is doing the job perfectly..SD 765G is Good Enough for daily usage and again 5G is also a Marketing Stunt ..After a week usage nothing special in this mobile except oxygen os ..so u can buy this mobile only for Os and 2yrs update support nothing more can expected .Pros1.Awesome Display with 90hz smooth refresh rate2.30W warp charger is a beast,charges the battery in just 50 mins3.Primary camera  lens is good.4.oxygen os is superb to use.Major cons1.macro lens and Depth not upto mark2.single speaker just loud,not crisp it could have been atleast stereo setup3.Nightscape is good but need lot of optimization via future updates4.765G with UFS 2.1 is working fast but not lighting speed like 8 series processors just good for daily use.5.4115 Mah is ok but makes to charge twice in 24 hr usage .if u r  not a pro user just a single charge is  enough."
141,Samrat,Great phone for someone who needs a smooth and flagship like performance from a mid ranged phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I'm happy with the way this phone performs. Lets point its features out:- Great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its 90 hz refresh rate, colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty.. side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway.- Performance is great 765G is more than enough for a lite user and by this I don't mean it won't perform if you want to play a few games on it. Works beautifully.- Now the only issue I came across while using this phone was its camera, even though it's being advertised for its bomb camera setup it's really not that special. The camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot. This said I am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before OnePlus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue (well at least I hope they do!!!).So to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that's just poor :'|"
142,Chinmoy,Just the smartphone you need,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The amoled display is pretty bright and amazingNice body, feels pretty premiumOxygen OS is clean and snappyRear main Camera is greatUltra wide is okishThough the macro one is not that goodBothI think it is value for money 💰Go for it 😃"
143,Amazon Customer,That's why people say don't purchase anything by looking just at its brand.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pathetic Camera, feels like shooting by 5MP camera wayback in 2005.Main camera is atleast useful, rest is just to increase the no of sensors, so that more money should be charged from consumer.Just like OP included WARP charger in box similarly I think, OP fitted WARP discharger in the phone.that's why NORD drains battery like no other phone must be draining. I am not a heavy user or gamer but I need to charge 2 times in a day to keep mobile powered on round the clock. Don't know how and why, people in review says that battery backup is good whereas it is pathetic. Just because OP is providing fast charger, it does not mean that user should always seat next to power supply socket all the time.Above said is my Frank opinion."
144,Ajay Singh,Poor Customer Service.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought oneplus Nord last week which was delivered on 14th Aug 2020.  Phone worked well for 1 days and it stopped working on Saturday night.  I found phone is turning off and on within 30 secs on Sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network.  It would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network.  It hangs and turn offs immediately.  I contacted Amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till Wednesday.  A technician will come on Wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not.  Nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early.  I have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product.Very pathetic service and will not recommend to Anyone.
145,Rahul Madhavan,Go for it if you need new phone. For upgrade you can wait,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall: 1. Solid phone. great camera2. Buy if you want 5G and have budget for 25-30k. Else you can go for realme/oppo at 10k lower cost.3. Much much better OS than xiomi/redmi. No bloatware. even oneplus app come default disabled!4. I loved the cameras even though online people have said camera is not so good. But again it's hit and miss. Some of the night pics (or those with light in background) i took seemed over-processed and/or pixelated. In such cases change the settings5. Sturidiness is good. But still buy with insurance. Screens once gone never come back!---5G: This is really something I don't think i'll need. i'm happy with 4G for all my needs. This shifting of spectrum is a total money making business. The shift from 3G-4G was necessary, but put unnecessary pressure on telecom players who had invested lakhs of crores on 3G spectrum for 20-30 year leases. That time reliance was the only early one to buy 4G spectrum at deep discounts (probably knowing before-hand about regime change). Again, I think 5G is a scam to help reliance make money (and 4G spectrum buyers like airtel lose money). I dont see myself needing 5G anytime in near future.Safety: I've broken my oppo 3 months back. Used an older Redmi. Which broke in one fall in 2 months. Used a broken phone for 2 months so this was important to me. This comes with plastic guard and screenguard inbuilt. Plastic guard is larger at corners.Weight: It seems sturdy enough. But lots of online reviews say the phone if mishandled can breakBatteries: Great fast charging! I charge once a day and charge for 30 minutes or so. even a five minute charge lasts for 2-3 hours (of video calling)Speed: I'm not a gamer or anything, but seems fast enough easily for all my needs.Close to Stock Android: I used to go for xiaomi and realme which completely spoil the android experience with their own versions. Might I say the xiaomi version was pure evil. It used to hoist a much of MI apps on me. If i uninstall MI Pay, the next morning, it used to come back, on it's own! Oxygen is such a relief after these. The OS -Muhc Much better than Xiaomi. Marginally better than Oppo and Realme.Build: I liked the build. It comes with its own cover. The cover has extra protection at the corners and has special seal for battery area so water doesn't get in.Camera: Comes with lots of cameras. How do these help? They give  the software a chance to build a composite image, capture more light in a shorter interval and get depth perception easier.Close up camera: I have captured a baby butterfly/moth which was smaller than a fingernail. This was at full zoom. Though i was only holding with hand, there is no blurriness on image. Details have come out adequately. Supposedly i could have done a macro but the camera interface doesn't easily open up all the features. For example I had to fiddle around before i could figure out how to switch on the flash.Nightvision Camera: 3 exhibits for your viewing pleassure. I have done a comparison between the actual photos in the night, and the modified photos as captured by the cameras. As you can see, the captures have completely improved the lighting. I have not captured using tripod for long exposure etc and yet shakiness is not too high. The starkest effect is in the selfie captured where it seems like day! the colors in the modified image are true to actuals. This was very surprising to me!Selfies: Good camera as gets nice depth. Use with google photos to ensure you never run out of space for photos!Color: Blue is my favorite color, and I love the pastel blue of this phone."
146,Sarthak,Overall Beast in this Price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is better to say it is very good deal right now(i bought when it was launched). It is very balanced phone, not a beast in any specific area. It must it is a phone which most of users want. Moreover, OxygenOs is icing on a cake.You are paying more price because of oxygen os. It will get some price cut.Cameras are above average. Main Camera (primary camera) is pretty good and ultra wide also captures good shots but due it is 8MP lens so details will get lost if you zoomed.Battery is one day. Although, you get 30T warp charger which charges a device 70% in 30 mins.No lags no heating issues no bloatware in software.Yeah, processor has less powerful as compared to 800 series processor but it easily done tasks as 845 do."
147,SHIVAM,Overhyped Phone ☹️,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Firstly One plus has make the customer fool during the OnePlus Nord Ar launch of amount ₹99 to all who Purchased their launch event card. About phone it is the most hyped phone which doesn't meet my expectations. Lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack.No Dedicated micro-sd card slot.The 2 MP and 5 MP cameras are useless. Overall build quality is good. Oxygen Os (Great Android Experience and future updates).Decent front and Rear cameras.The In-display fingerprint scanner.Fast Processor and Above Average Display.The battery is decent and supports fast charging.
148,Ashish Kumar,Excellent Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One Plus has come up with a great product in correct pricing. This is what is required.The cameras are superb and at par with phones costlier than thisFast chargingIt is 5G ready. Means when 5G will come to India this feature will be enabled through OTA. Only one Sim will be 5G . Other will be 4G. Remember it is like older phones when 4G was avaiable in only one sim in dual phones.One Plus Nord is a good buy
149,Anindaya S Rana,A very balanced phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It is not a flagship if you want that experience. It is a really good midrange experience coming from one of the better brands. You can certainly get more value for money from other brands however the quality of software support and customer service from OnePlus is better than all such brands. A must buy especially if you love oxygen os or just want a reliable device to use for 2-3 years .
150,Neha Sharma,Oxygen OS and display tries to make up for pathetic cameras but fails,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Following is my review of the device -PROS -1. The display is amazing.2. Oxygen OS is really clean, good, and easy to use.3. The Alert Slider button is helpful.4. Charging is fast ( not as much as Realme X2 pro but quite fast)CONS -1. The camera is bad, really bad. Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices."
151,Abhay Kumar,Perfect mid ranger by miles!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's the perfect mid ranger. It's snappy and smooth with 90 hz, display is good albiet a tad low on brightness. Will test with 60z on and update later on. The best thing about the Nord is the OxygenOS. Got an update to version 10.5.5 immediately on starting the phone. The phone is a bit tall and I would have liked a bit more width like Samsung M30s which was was previous phone before this. The warp charge works as promised ... got to 0%-100% in 107 mins after the phone was installed with almost 100 apps, which I thing I was consuming some battery in the background. Haven't tasted camera much except couple of selfies which  turned out perfectly okay in night light, and daylight photography returned decent pictures. About sound quality - music volume is pretty loud for a mono speaker and can get distorted on full volume. Call volume is good but not very load. Phone speaker volume is a bit on low side which I disliked. Marble blue colour shines on day light and night which looks awesome. The phone case provided with the box is good one. Start guide is a joke and not much given in it except placement of various buttons. Will update more since it's been only a day of usage for me."
152,Varun Krishnan,Utterly disappointing!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  ‌OnePlus had always come across as a company that delivered on its promises to customers. But sadly, the Nord marks their deviation from this customer-centric philosophy. They have stooped to the level of mediocre companies making empty claims about their products! Nord is utterly disappointing, its cameras (claimed to be on par with OP 8 series) is worse than ones found in below 15k phones ,  monospeaker gives tough competition to those in cheapest phones ,  display has pink tinting issue, battery drains in no time, all in all it points to use of substandard hardware all round which makes this phone not worth even 15k!!  OnePlus also seems to have bought out all the top reviewers so that they can effectively mislead prospective buyers."
153,Rajesh Hali,Nord is worth the hype,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Worth the hype.Good phone in this budget segment.Bought the 12gb ram 256 gb on pre order and am satisfied with the performace. Camera takes good photos in natural light and with flash. Selfie camera is also good. Battery life is not that great . Does drain quite quiclky. The finishing looks premium with Corning gorilla glass on the front and the back. Heavy duty games work sufficiently well with a little heating.
154,APURAV,Disappointing from one plus.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I have order nord on pre book day. I want to order blue marble 256Gb but it was not available on 28 July. So I compromise and order grey one. My friend order blue marble on 6 August on open sale day and recevied phone on 7 August. Even though I order phone on pre booking day (28july) I received on 8 august. Very disappointing from one plus as they delivered product to open sale customer rather than those customer who has booked phone on pre booking day. I want to get replace it with blue one. I trying to contact Amazon through call but they disable call us option for this product. One plus just created hype for Nord. They didn't provided customer service. There is also issue in bullet z connection.
155,Gopinath,Worth for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It's above average for mid range phones.1) Battery life is good it's regular normal using stand by 14 hrs2) Gaming performance : It's average only and playing games some network connectivity issues happened3 ) Display is really nice / daily usage feel better4) Camera : Below average only software updates required .In night time it's quality is very low..
156,SK,👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the few disadvantages is that 3.5mm jack is missing (supports only bluetooth earphones) and also supports only and only nano sim...otherwise the price range and the features considered, it's a great phone to buy within that budget 👍"
157,Arvind,Don't go for negative reviews ! THIS PHONE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  THIS PHONE IS JUST AMAZING.ALL FEATURES IN ONE PHONE AT THIS PRICE NOTHING LESS THAN A FLAGSHIP PHONE .SURELY YOU CAN GO FOR IT , WITH CLOSED EYES"
158,Alfin Philip,Well it's not as bad as people say it is !!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A lot of people have given their expert opinions here so I'm just gonna address a few things.1)Display:- Yes there is a tint issue but I feel Oxygen Os 10.5.7.AC01DA has solved it to an extent.My recommended setting isDisplay calibration>Advanced>Display P3 and tone it down to cold.2)Camera:- I seriously don't know why people are soooo critical about the cameras. I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great. It's mainly due to that 90hz refresh rate.P.S:-Not attaching any photos there are enough of them here 😂
159,kyu btau,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.* Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.* 60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that.* The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.* The phone looks and feels premium while using.* Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)i suggest this nord for who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints.."
160,You,A truly mediocre phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus phone so I had my expectations in check. After using it for a while I feel indifferent towards the brand itself as there's absolutely nothing remarkable about this phone worth talking about which why I'll only be talking about the issues I have with this phone.Had poor charging speeds at first. After a few System updates, that fixed it for me even though there was nothing about battery in the change log.Camera is...well not a flagship by any means as they've tried it market it to their fans. If this is what passes for flagship these days, OnePlus is going to have a hard time ahead. Apparently, it's the same module as the OnePlus 8 but the functionality is limited and quality worse even. Although I personally think for a 30k phone, it's okay.I don't play games on my phone but after watching a movie for a few minutes the display does heat up a little. Nothing too serious yet but time will tell. Any heat issues will more or less cause the battery to degrade faster.There's an problem with my phone where sometimes after a fresh boot the phone will not show SIM signal for some reason even though it detects it just fine. Another reboot does fix it all the time but it's minor inconvenience/nuisance that shouldn't be happening.The UI is pretty clean. Don't have many complaints here except for the gaming software bloatware and the lack of a music app. Yes, yes I know there's many apps in the Playstore that gets the job done but that is true for literally most OnePlus apps yet it didn't stop them for making those. Coming from a Samsung phone, it's a problem for me because Samsung has their own music and video player that don't show ads or anything. It does have Google Play music app but I didn't like the orange UI with light background and other playstore apps don't integrate with the OnePlus lockscreen well."
161,shweta jaiswal,Reasonable product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  For 28k and some exchange I found this product value for money. For 30k I don't think so, reason being camera quality in low light conditions is poor. Marketing on the basis of 4 camera is being done by one Plus but it turns out that macro camera is not good at all.I would definitely say that picture quality in day light conditions is osm. Gaming experience is smooth with no heating issues. Better life n charging speed bith are phenomenon."
162,Amazon Customer,Delivary and customer service very poor,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone Is Great Deal with Premium feel and Touch.I bought original one plus cover and glass protection.Back cover gives premium feel .Amoled screen enhances overall experiences.Friends don't listen to youtubers .No tint issues no lags .Those who expect high end features in 30 k just grab the deal.Only issue faced with Amazon prime delivary .Amazon delivery agents threaten to cancel the delivary if i not collect it from its warehouse.Due to urgecy i had to collect it.I called the customer care but they could not able to fix the issue.I experienced third class delivary despite Amazon prime member.Delivary agents don't even protect the privacy of customers they ask for product information .

165,Jayakumar,"After Oneplus X, my 2nd Oneplus Phone is ""NORD""",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is good looking and handy, feels like a premium phone, Camera is awesome and must buy phone under 30,000/-. More fully it doesn't feel more weight and feels really weightless one and warp charge also does its job quickly and when my phone is at 80%, while you charge it shows 8 to 9 minutes to get fully charged. Phone doesn't get heat while charging....including charge holder."

167,Nelson O J,"Stable, reliable, feature rich, almost a flagship!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A well made product when it comes to build quality. The processor is fairly capable, no slouch at all.Coming from a OnePlus 3 as my previous phone and this feels like a major upgrade, no lags, no stutters and looks great too.The macro camera was sub par but has gotten better with updates,  the rest of the camera array is great.Speaker sounds decent.No network issues so far.Great battery life and charging speed is pretty good.When I'm buying a phone I usually look for being able to use all my apps without issues, a good video and photo camera and a reliable battery.This ticks all those boxes.In fact this has reduced my battery anxiety quite a bit as it lasts and allows for a fair bit of usage and a quick 15 to 20 minutes top-up allows you to keep going for quite a bit.The relative stability of Oxygen OS makes it a reliable daily driver."
168,Navi,Warm Display Auto Brightness Issues Green Pink Violet Tint Issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Everything is fine except that green pink violet tint issues and warm display issues auto brightness issues i got headache due to that issuesAnd when i approached Amazon they responded quickly but they're not able to provide a replacement so with a heavy heart proceeded with a refundBut now I'm in a confusion should i buy again or notBecause i want a mobile without any issues because we're spending 30k and we don't change mobile's so often so i need a mobile without any issuesIf you're okay with the issues you can buy it without any confusion and if you're lucky enough you'll get a mobile without any display or ant issues good luck with your new Nord
169,Sunil Kumar,"awesome deal, go for it if u have a budget of (25-30k)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  battery-unexpectedly good,1.5 day for normal use (i am not a gamer and never gave heavy load on phone)camera-(main)-good enough, better thn all mid range phones of this range and excellent dynamic range.micro camera_ totally trash :( (also not my requirement)video camera-(first class) 4k is awesome and video stablization is decentfront camera- ok ok type for this range of phonedisplay- good display (no low light tint issue)look- loved its look, awesome balanced weightOS- awesome and best experience on oxygen, found a lot of new features in this phone"
170,Amazon Customer,Best premium phone is budget value.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  if you are looking for premium phone with below mention quality.1. Best UI ( Speed interaction with app and ad free2. Best camera quality - camera is same as oneplus 83. best AMOLED screen - awesome black and brightness, vivid color experience4. Best battery back up and charging speed- 1 hr full charge/ 30 min - 70%5. 90HZ smooth refresh rate - it actually cool if haven't experience6. great loud speaker quality - its feels premium and with little bass -7. compact size phone - not big and not small - perfect hand size for all daily use.8. support of good developers and quality team -from my side there is no CON in phone as my last phone was redmi note 4 ( we should create less e waste and Value our money )I miss headphone jack, however we should accept modern technology and use Bluetooth earphone as 3.5mm jack is way more old technology.i suggest spend on phone who last long with less ( zero ) problems so choose it wisely, instead of spending 20K- 23k on redmi, samsung or other, Oneplus really provide value for money."
171,Rajesh,Experience with display is a big disappointment.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations. Amzed with the features offered, I Pre-ordered Oneplus nord and waited 9 days for the delivery. After switching on my device, I just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display. This is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels. My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying."
172,Manish Singh,Not up to the mark(From a Oneplus fan),4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I m a OnePlus fan, still disappointed. The green and magenta tint on display is very real, whenever there is something grey on the screen which will be  a lot if you use dark mode, the display just goes crazy, showing all tints from green to pink.Secondly, there are some issues with Google Play services that doesn't load up a search or a page in one go but that might get fixed with ota.Cameras are a mixed bag, if you take selfies soo much, it sucks in indoor lighting conditions, very good in outdoors but not indoors.Rest of the phone is what you would expect, 90Hz display,you will forget after using it for a day and when u go back to 60hz it's not a discernable difference as every reviewer says so. You will see difference b/w 60 nd 120hz but not so much here.Buy this only if you are looking for a OnePlus phone, otherwise there's better out there."
173,Manju,Just LOVING it!!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The main highlight is the software experience u get....it's just awesomeAnd i would say it's overall balanced phoneDecent picturesDescent audio from the monospeakerDescent haptic feedbackDecent premiumnessBut one issue : it has slight tint issue in the grey background (ignorable)I would say its worth it!!!!
174,Amit singh,Totaly satisfied and happy with the performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome phone,great performance, no lag while gaming,I have tried pubg, cod, asphalt 9 all are running super smoth at high settings,charging is also super fast, No screen issue for me, Totaly satisfied with the phone. Don't listen to the youtubers they are all sold to other brands, trust me you will not get a better phone than this at 30k price."
175,abhinav,Overall Good Performance but with mediocre Camera performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  No problem with the Nord Performance, as usual it poses no problem in daily taks, also Oxygen OS is best out there but the most advertised feature ^Camera^ isn't that good. The front camera selfie in indoor shot is not clear , it's giving whitish on face , also the back camera 48MP is best but it has less features , the macro and depth camera doesn't give satah factory result. The camera isn't good in this one. Hjghl disappointed.maybe some update in future will help in this issue"
176,Devaraj Samuel,Not as much as u Think or Expect,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Just after using one day the phone os crashed... had to boot to the main menu using power n volume button.. i didn't update the system after installing new apps from play store .. system update - is that a reason to blame..If so - y can't it be made forceful...For a 30k phone the hand experience by improving the build quality s expected.. one plus 5 s more solid i feel
177,Amazon Customer,Worst Phone Don't Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am using dual  sims. after every 2-3 hours, outgoing and incoming call facility is not working. although there is full network. then I had switch on the aeroplane mode and off the same to enable the calls"
178,Arun,Network detection keeps losing,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  when you go and come back to low network area, phone loses its connection with the network and never recovers, need to restart the phone. This is a major problem, lot of my friends/relatives started complaining that am not reachable for the whole day. Oneplus, you need to work on this.Redmi note 8 pro was far better than this."
179,Sambit Sahoo,Wonderful phone 🔥👌.. but seriously getting many problems.. it's really true.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I really loved everything.. its UI.. features.. battery life is really good.. charging speed is also well.. other all aspects are pretty good.. speakers are not that bad.. enough for a phone but still it lacks.. camera is good.. but expections were much high..Accessories costs very much.. Overall good one but now comes to its issues..That display tint issue.. connectivity problems sometimes.. then idk why but charging is not that fast.. then game like ff isn't working properly idk still why.. camera optimization is poor..PLEASE THOSE WHO ALL HAVE THESE GREEN TINT ISSUE IN YOUR PHONES BETTER TO GET A REPLACEMENT OR RETURN.. BECAUSE IT'S A HARDWARE FAULT.. I've gone for a replacement n as stocks aren't there so I got the refund. Better do it unless you want a defect product..🙂
180,HG,Pathetic Phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone has severe network issues and loses network very frequently. Call drops and Network unavailable most of the time. This is not an operator issue as I'm at home only in lockdown and get proper signal in other phones in the house.Secondly, even if you manage to get network, the phone has a very bad heating problem. Within 5-10 minutes of voice call the phone heats up badly and becomes unusable. You have to wait for it to cool before being able to use again.Lastly, the battery drain is too bad. Morning 8am at 100% gets to single digit by 5pm with average usage. If I try to watch videos/game then it goes down faster, but you don't have to worry about it as within 15 minutes of watching video/gaming the phone will heat up and give you a notification that some functions have been disabled to reduce temperature. So you don't worry about watching video or gaming for long.Overall too many bugs which are not resolved. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.."

183,LonelyiGamer,"Product, great as expected, shipping from Amazon, wasn't the best",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord is most probably the best in this price segment and apart from Google Pixel, nothing would come anywhere near, camera is pretty good, my only problem is the Macro camera. It doesn't do any good and it's just an additional, main camera is pretty much does the same as the Macro does"
184,ABDUL VAHAB A M,Awesome mobile.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint Reader is very fast when comparing to other brands.Battery life is pretty draining.

185,Chunu,My expectations for this phone gone into Disappointment 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using this phone about a month.Facing problems like its gone in booting mode automatically and it takes 15-20 min to restart the phone again .Second thing is its charging speed gone slow .In first month its charging speed (0 to70% in 30min) is like as said by a company .But now it take 1h30min to full charge . I am very disappointed.Camera quality is goodBattery is also goodFace unlock is mind blowing very excellent 5/5 rating.Charging speed 2/5
186,Priyanka,Beware of Fanboys 😡 'Must Read',1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day."
187,akh1l,Battery really gave up within a week.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very happy at first buying an oneplus phone and was also very satisfied by it's performance but today it's just been around a week since I bought the phone and aside from the lacking of processor like I already knew settling for a lesser snapdragon processor would only provide little stability and max graphics of HD at games like PUBG, but today aside from the quality lacking in front camera like clearly phones like galaxy M31 provide a much better front camera I saw this status in battery and the phone got really heated up and the battery status showed that it needed 1 hour and 45 minutes to get fully charged I mean a warp charging phone how can it show signs like this within the first week itself. Really disappointed from oneplus on this one."
188,Amazon Customer,Loyal customer to one plus,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon.Likes: Phone is simply awesome. This is my second buy from One Plus (first one was one plus 3t). In simple words i really loved the phone.  The grey one looks really nice. Though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice. Good one.Well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack . We need to use a connector . Rest all good. I guess the One Plus Lite model will have that wire jack feature.
189,kartik,Had second thoughts while ordering but now loved it..,4.0 out of 5 stars,   4.5stars from my side.The rear camera is good specially the 48mp mode . The only thing which is useless is the macro camera.The selfie shooter is good. Just a bit of distort in potrait mode .But i believe all the camera problems which people are feeling will be fixed by updates.Just like it was in the first realme phones.The gaming experience is good.Refresh rate and game mode helps alot.Tried both PUBG and ASPHALT 9The sound from the speakers are good.Charging was super quick.Battery ran for the day despite of high usage .The inscreen Fingerprint is a bit Slow but the faceunlock is superfast..Overall its a must buy for the person who dreamt of buying oneplus but cud not cz of the budget ..Also its a 5G enabled phone .I mean go for it guys..

191,Raksha,OnePlus Nord - Just An Average phone!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received phone today! Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery!To all Nord buyers please consider this review seriously!!!Oneplus Nord made a lot of buzz but delivers nothing much great!Camera - 2/5 just average*Quality - 2/5 , the cost cutting is so visible!Display - 3/5 ,it's bright but not impressive...Gaming - 2/5 ,especially Pubg players please stay away from this! Performance is too poor and graphics settings are very low... Don't get fooled by  any YouTube videos!Color - 4.5/5 It's bold and colorfull..Fingerprint - 4/5 works really fast!Overall - 2.5/5 Expected more then wat received and the expectations were set by the OnePlus Ads..To all oneplus premium users or New buyers this phone is not for you, please go by the specs not by company's name! From my experience , OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 6T is way better then Nord! So I suggest you to go for OnePlus 7T/Realme X2 pro..I ll add/update after a month if changes found 👍"
192,vicky,I hope I use it atleast for 1 year,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am giving feedback after use of 1 week. Over all phone is good, sometime it gets slow. I faced hanging issue at the very first day but then after that did not face such issue . Sometime I can't listen any voicemails or videos, it gets blanked then I have to restart device. It happened twice in a week and when it's brand new phone it's not acceptable. Only 48 MP cam is quite good, rest all are ok ok but not good..I don't know why this people have gave that 2 MP cam, instead of that they would have given 3.5 mm jack or something else.  Battery life is more than average, it's good to use. I only love one thing that is charger. I will edit review later if anything gets changes in performance.Facing bluetooth connectivity issue like alot. It's not acceptable."
193,Bikash Borah,Average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Average product but price little bit high. I have been using this phone since 48hours and my view regarding the user experience and overall performance I mentioned below as pro and cons formatPro: 1. Clean and clear android OS and fully customisable2. Fully charge within 30-45min from 10-12%3. Battery performance not so bad (7-8 hours) (4-5hours with 90Hz RR and game like COD/A9)4. Dark mode is awesome5. Processors works good with high end games like CoD/PUBG/A96. Premium feels without coverCons :1. Heating issue with high end game and apps like Unacademy2. Camera dept very worst. Only main cam works fine other 3cam just for show off3. If you switch from LCD screen to OLED you will feel pain in your eyes or sever dizziness Within 30mins of use4. YouTube Video available up to 1080. 4K video option not available5. Fingerprint And face unlock features , I Donot think it’s secure enough6. Plastic side body so use with care. I got screech within a hour of unboxing7. 90Hz RR consume more juice than 60hzMore pro and cons will be updates soon......"
194,Abhishek Mehta,Amazing Phone - One Plus Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best valued phone which I got. 12 Gb Ram and 256 Gb storage at the best price. I have actually booked the phone on 27th July and received the phone 1 day before the launch. I was surprised on the Delivery Schedule of Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the early delivery.One Plus phones I always rely on for a longer term of about 2 to 3 years. Upgrading my One Plus 6 to Nord was an outstanding deal. Thanks One Plus for early dispatch.About the phone :1. It is 5G Ready, though we don’t have 5G Network in India. (It’s coming)2. The camera quality is outstanding.3. Voice output same as other One Plus models4. A little sleeker than other models.5. Finish on the edges is truly praising.6. Colour of the phone (Grey) is soothing.7. Transparent back bumper Cover along with the phone is of good quality.All in all, I love this phone so much I am planning to buy one more."
195,shree,NORD so far.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall perfomance of the phone is amazing.best in class perfomance in this price range .It feels really nice in the hands.Best diplay for this price i'd say. Camera is definitely similar to oneplus 8,but its not the same although,nord is lacking some of the features of oneplus 8 camera.charging is pretty fast 0 to 100 in less than an hr. eventhough the battery is morethan 4000 mah the display and hardware comsumes a lot of power, so battery backup is not so great but above average.Operating system is lot smoother with less bugsOverall i my perspective,considering the brand value and the product value oneplus is giving,for sure it ll be really a money worth purchase.PROS*Supperb camera perfomance in this price range .*Pretty quick charging.*Nyz display in this price*Front camera wide angle is awesome.*bigger display and 90Hz refresh rate.*Smooth os with less bugs.CONS*Lacking the premium buit quality out of the box.Overall its a plastic body*The volume mute slider feels a bit low quality in the daily usage.*In display fingerprint scanner is not as faster as a sidemounted scanner.*Battery backup is not great as expected but considering the display size ,its ok with that.*Sometimes proximity censor goes crazy while calling and endup with making the call hold or muted probably."
196,Sameer Kulkarni,Premium Device in Higher Midrange: Must Read!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is a decent High-Mid range smartphone which gives promising performance and overall great value for money.Look & In-hand feel:Excellent look and build except the frame which is plastic. Corning gorilla glass 5 on both sides is good protection against physical scratches and damages. In hand weight balance is pretty good. Doesn't feel heavier.Build quality:With some compromises due to its price, it's still a robust device to own. A typical premium feel.UI & OS:Excellent job. No complaints here. Clean UI and bloatware free OS gives a seamless performance.Battery:Average 7 hours SoT with normal usage.So decent battery life. No heating issues. 30T warp charging does a great job. 50~55 min for 0 to 100.Camera:Good hardware for camera in place, but scope of improvement still exists.Pros:-Great 90Hz fluid amoled display-5G enabled-Clean UI-Decent Camera-Alert slider-30 watt fast chargingCons:-No expandable storage-No headphone jackVerdict:Go for it if you want decent overall performance as Q 765G won't offer the same performance as Q 855 or 855+ hence gamers need to rethink. Overall Great Device!"
197,Swapneel,Ignore YouTube reviews and Go For Nord and experience best in class product from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ignore all reviews on YouTube or any other channel and you will have a best phone in your hand and that is OnePlus Nord. I gone through reviews but still I took chance and now I am totally satisfied with my decision of buying Nord. Everything is best in class from built quality to cameras and performance. Super smooth performance without any lag and also no ads big relief. For headphone jack you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy usb c type to 3.5 mm jack converter from local market,I got it for 120rs and believe me it is awesome sound with powerful base.(my headphones are of iphone). Phone speaker is very loud most of us use headphones so that is not a issue. Macro camera is not that good bt again that's not a big issue bcz rear camera click stunning pictures also nightscape mode gives superb results. Front camera is awesome. Battery backup a big thumbs up for it bcz I am normal user. Charges in time which is promised by company. Finally Never Settle for any other phone go for Nord."
198,Nikhil Khot,Bad Camera and Tint issue with display! Otherwise great phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's really great device and awesome daily driver. But it's seems like OnePlus really lacks in camera and display quality. Yes camera is bad if you someone who want better camera and take lot of pictures then this phone is not for you at all. About the display well display is good but yes it do have tint issue and it's noticable and also effecting using experience if your really serious about color and pictures as a artist or creative person well it might bother you some time specially in night or low brightness condition. So at the end it's good phone to buy and hopefully OnePlus may fix this issue vai update. Give it thought before you buy and also look for some other options. Other things like battery, figure print, charging works fine and no lag at all."
199,jerald raja,Not a good midrange mobile,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  *Being OnePlus user from oneplus3.. Expected lot from this mobile..  *Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles.OnePlus 5 series is the last premium mobile from op.  *one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced  *don't go on brand name and look.  *Now a days samsung is very strong with their midrange mobiles.  *1.Camera is literally bad, I mean really really bad  2. If you are a selfie lover please don't go with this  3. CPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships  4. Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output  5.Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBG  6.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS  7.Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  8.Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength*"
200,pollam vinod yadav,Nord is a flop moblie it just created a hype,1.0 out of 5 stars,  My phone is good but after I got delivered it stopped working on 5th day I got software problem and it started rebooting itself I went to one plus customer service and I got replaced after one week and I have seen there same problem like me by many persons so please don't buy this product.at this cost u can another moblie.
201,Aryan Upadhyay,"Worth buying, kind of.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honest review.3 Things I liked the most-1. DisplayIt's a quite good display with colour vibrancy and gool colour reproduction. Its 90hz panel so it's smooth af too. Amoled display with 90hz is just heaven. Viewing angles ? GREAT!2. Battery lifeI'm getting around 19 hrs of battery life on one full charge which is decent because I don't do much of gaming in this, I just use it for social media, youtube and stuff.3. ChargingIt's bloody fast in charging like it charges 10% to 90% under 40 mins which is quite good.And other things like processor, ram, storage is fast, looks premium in hand since bulid quality and looks are eye catching, every camera is good and can take beautiful pictures but I found macrolens camera useless.Thing which I didn't like is that it doesn't have a headphone jack so now my bose wired headphones are somewhat useless while using this phone.Thank you for reading."
202,Sujeet,Don't buy Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   I didn't accepted from one plus brand 'Nord' please don't buy this One plus Nord . I don't want to give any star,but for review I will giving one star .guys plz check my video before purchasing this nord device and I visited one plus store they updated and installed new software again same issue with this device so plz don't buy"
203,Bhoopendra Uikey,Not what I expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Screen :- very good, AMOLED 90hz screen is a beauty, very impressed with it.2. Camera :- images look very grainy in indoor photos, can be easily fixed with software update, using gcam for now, day and night difference.3. Audio :- was not expecting that good sound but it has very good single speaker.4. Performance :- Device not optimised for gaming.  This phone was having frame drops even in 2d games. My previous 14k phone had less frame drop than this. Although graphics were better in this phone.5. Battery :- good enough battery, not great.6. Software :- I had ordered this because of oos, but in new update they have changed whole ui and it looks nothing like stock. Stock-like ui was the reason I had ordered this. I guess I have to rely on custom ROMs just like my last phone.Edit: Now after 1 week I am completely disappointed with its performance, too much frame drops even compared to sd730g mobiles, I'm not talking about games like pubg or so, it skips frame even in Subway surf and too much frame skips in Minecraft and angry birds transformer, latter two are almost unplayable for me. These games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games, terrible optimization, I was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games, which it is notEdit : just installed call of duty, surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops. They were there, but I was looking for them, otherwise smooth experience, do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not, I did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate, which it delivers in cod but in others, fails to do so"
204,Pranav Khedekar,"Amazing Display and Performance, Sub-Par Camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a mixed bag of goodies and baddies. As usual, the Unboxing experience is Wholesome and includes an amazing Red Cable Club's Membership Card which is mesmerizing to stare at for hours. As for the phone, like aforementioned it's kind of mixed review. Firstly, the display is amazing for 28k and with that 90Hz display the phone dosent feels less than an flagship. Camera is Sub-Par (which was expected as OnePlus do not have a very good track record with Camera's ), but it's not that bad either. It captures some amazing details in good-light conditions, but under low-light conditions, things go downhill. Also, OnePlus should have avoided that Quad-Camera gimmick and instead of 2MP Macro camera should have developed or perfected the Main sensor for Low-Light conditions. Also the front shooters are good, but beautify the photo too much, that the photos look unreal. Also, didn't quite understand why OnePlus introduced 4K 60fps video recording in front cams, and deprived main camera setup of this. Other than that, the phone is as good as one can get in this in this price-point. The OxygenOS is alone an amazing reason why you should choose this phone over others. It's beautifuly optimized and together with that 90Hz panel gives an flagship like performance (apparently). As for actual performance, 765G is not an bad chipset and is decent for casual gaming and more than enough for smooth performance in  daily life. The battery is amazing and so is 30W Warp charger. So, the bottom line is if you want an future-proof smartphone with decent performance, go for this one. But if you are looking an device for Heavy gaming or Mobile photography, then this is not an ideal phone for you. Finally, no device is perfect, but this one without an doubt is bang for buck."
205,Abhishek P.,Great phone but poor marketing gimmick by Amazon by showcasing Reviewers edition hard cases,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is amazing in terms of experience, customisation, battery life and camera quality - yes, the rumours about camera quality isn't true and I'm very happy with it. However, the seller and Amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that I never received. Even after complaining to Amazon customer care, I was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to Amazon, hence passing the buck! Not a great experience!"
206,karan vig,Touch,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I used to play pubg by 4 or 3 finger claw but in this phone nord I can't properly play by 3 fingers because I'm so much problem with multitouch so this is happen with me only or its a phone bug.
207,Dhananjay,One of the best phone in this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Been using this phone for about 15 days now and I think it's one of the best phones in this price range. Everything is good. I mean it's not as good as a flagship but in this price range everything we have is amazing. The screen is amazing. And you can buy this phone for oxygen is only. Cameras are good, primary camera is great and wide angle is good too. But other two are just there for the quad camera perform and nothing much they don't have manu use here I mean the depth camera is good but if you cover it and then click a portrait pic then also you will get the same pic. But overall if your budget is under 30k then go for this phone you will love the experience."
208,Arpita,Worst phone ever by Oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of my biggest bad decision to buy oneplus nord. One of the useless phone I have ever seen. There is several reasons behind my sentences.1. There is no 3.5 Jack so u have to buy Bluetooth earphone, and Bluetooth is not working at all. It's not detecting oneplus earphones and if it's connected it will disconnect in few minutes. Go and search on Google u will get lots of topic regarding this.2. Phone music quality is too bad on every earphone.3. Phone doesn't have SD card support, so you can't take any backup directly to external memory. What was happened to me and I lots approx 300+ contacts and huge amount of photos.4. The mobile software has huge bugs and I am damn sure it was not tested properly.5. Mobile has plastic body, seriously for what I paid this much amount. Backside Chinese logo?6. Battery is too bad, even it's not capable to run for full day.I just want my money back and take this nonsense, most irritated device."
209,Rohit Jain,Worst display,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst Display.It is having green tint issue not only in dark mode or dark environment. You can see the tinting also in Google Chrome opening page . Shades of green and different patches of whites sha des are clearly noticeable. Display is really an issue . Do think before buying
210,Ayon Chakraborty,Awesome purchase!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay, I was extremely excited for my first OnePlus smartphone.Most of the things are awesome in this price point but there are few things which is disappointing.1) Camera: It's good but not best for indoor photography. But as I observed, it shows the picture and after capturing and processing, it tweaks with contrast, colors, etc etc.. Therefore, I assume the problem I mentioned can be fixed by an update2) Battery: It's neither good nor bad. It lasts for 5hrs to 8hrs depending on the usage @90hz refresh rate. But downgrading the refresh rate to 60hz and enabling battery saver pushes this to 8hrs to 10hr average. But using this @90hz without battery saver is the one I do because of the fast charging. It's just awesome! It charged 60% to 100% in 20 minutes.I am coming from a low budget android *Redmi note 3*If you are thinking to upgrade from any similar or equivalent device, I would definitely recommend to do so because those are the only two problems I faced tbh. and they are not as problematic. The oxygen os with this 8Gb ram, SD765g, and 90hz display is extremely smooth."
211,Unni K Nayanar,The best option you can get...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is dope on both software and the quality. The camera quality is great but not that great when it is in macro mode . There are a few bugs when using camera on certain apps , the quality of the photo decreases. The battery life is good . The wrap charging is not upto the point . The front camera notch gets me irritated while playing games as some of the buttons go under it and you won't get to know. Other than the bugs , this is the best phone in premium budget category.Once you start using OnePlus phones you never want to go into an another mobile company . OnePlus is ❤️"
212,Mudit,Oneplus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone.Great price.I am amazed with warp charger as it charges within an hour from 19%to 100%.I was new to oneplus so didn't knew that phone should be charged with company charger and lead else it could affect battery life but getting used to it.Though Nord is a cheaper version of oneplus but I found it premium quality and upto mark in all respect from camera quality, finger print sensor to multi tasking.Battery is good but will last only one day or less if you are a heavy user but since charging is very fast so you are least worried.So if you are looking for a premium mobile that is 5G enabled plus less than 30k go for it, you won't repent."
213,SAMPATH,I loved it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really loved it.Using this for a day, and its really amazing and I love it.I didn't observe any tint issue on my piece at least. Even if there is any issue at low brightness, that doesn't effect the regular user in anyway.The only competitor I see to Oneplus nord at this point of time is Realme X2pro.If you are confused between these two:1. Go with Realme only if you want it for games and want the 55W fast charging.2. Go with Oneplus if you want an overall great experience, with the software, camera, changing, processor. And I think it's perfect phone at this price segment.Pros:1. 90Hz display.2. Oxygen OS.3. Stable 4k Video recording.4. 32mp front camera does a great job.5. 5G support with a great processor.6. 30W charging and battery that lasts for a day on heavy use.7. Assured software updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years.Cons:I really don't see any cons, at least, at this point. I will update my review after 1 month of usage.But I think they can improve the camera for low light conditions, and I expect that gets fixed with the future updates."
214,nazeer,Expectation vs reality. 3 star product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had a very bad luck with Nord..Phone design and looks-5starBattery - 3 star gets heated up and drains fastCamera - 2 star definitely not good , night view is horrible.Charging - 5 star , 100% in 35 minPrice- very high , 3 star.No headphones jack, no wifi direct,no expandable memory,  no 5g .I had to return this product.10 star for Amazon service. Refunded post inspection  and very humble reps.Regards. A true prime customer."
215,Bharat Baban Avhad,Don't buy Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus nord is not good as well as expecting things which is not having one plus' own oxygen osNord having stock android ,its not good os which is I had already used with Nokia 6.1 plus it unsatisfied and frustratingThat's why I'm changing my phone but bad luck and wastage of moneyI requested to Amazon team don't misguided to common peoples through yours purchasing ad, there is seen oxygen Os but instead of oxygen os stock android provide please.... don't do thatPlease change ur selling policy and declared in specification which os is working....It's very frustrating..now I'm going change that phone..one plus 8 from local market not from Amazon because bad experience... not only bad but also wastage of money 29999.00"
216,Saksham9888,Better than expected..!!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using one plus for the first time, and honestly i was not expecting this good build quality and fit finish.Other than standard things, display is extremely good, haptic feedback is very tight  and powerful, speaker is sadly mono channel unlike other oneplus which offers stereo set up but overall speaker is loud enough and rich in sound.Rest of the things are as expected, only one issue, which onplus didn't add type c to 3.5 mm dongle in the box."
217,sidharth,Overall a good Buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   The phone performs as advertised. Smoot and no lags or stutters so far. Have been using it for about a month now. Main 48mp sensor does well, wide angle is good when there's plenty of light. Macro lense I would say is useless I don't use it. Updates have made the cameras and overall performance better.Display tinit issue is present on my device but after few weeks I stopped noticing it and have attached a video also. Video makes it a little exaggerated*At first I thought it was just too severe  of an issue to let go but then you will just stop noticing it. So didn't opt for return or replacement. P.s.Amazon had offered me a full refund or replacement option.Battery life and charging is good I get about 7.5hrs and heavy usage 6.5hrs  SOT @90hz full time."
218,Soham,Great product and just go for it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this product on prime day sale for ₹26,500 and I would say it is worth of every rupee I paid. The charging is really fast with the 30W charger. Camera quality is not really great but quite good for day to day use. Fingerprint sensor works really well.90 hertz display is really smooth but battery consuming. just one thing that is missing from this phone is 3.5 mm jack, so Mostly you have to use Bluetooth headphones."
219,Venkatesh,One Plus quality is amazing had a bitter experience with Exchange.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus quality is amazing but Had a bitter experience with exchange . The delivery guy didnt hand over the new phone, stating that Verify your exchange option is showing up in the app. Please contact the customer care. After contacting customer care, they didnt help any aspect. I had figure out myself. On the day of delivery, you would get an sms, after clicking on the link provided in the sms it opens in the app and Verify your exchange option would be displayed. After that exchange was sucessfull. Amazon needs to train the delivery agent, how would a buyer know all these things. I had already paid the amount online.Phone quality is amazing and camera quality is good. Fingerprint sensor is ok not bad."
220,Avijit,Worthy upgrade from 1+ 3T,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using my OnePlus 3T for almost 3 years now and I still didn't feel the need to upgrade from there since my screen of that phone is gone. Being an OnePlus fan I was eyeing for 7T. But I couldn't justify the price for that according to my day to day needs.So not being a hard-core user of mobiles I started looking for other options which will fulfill my usage without spending extra bucks. And the day 1+ announced the Nord i knew this will be my next mobile. It's a fantastic daily driver with decent camera quality (unless you're a mobile photographer please wait for the Pixel 4a)Now coming to my pros and cons-Pros:1. Battery life is excellent. Getting almost more than a day with 100% charge.2. Display is fluid and ""big"" (do keep in mind I was using 3T for 3 years now so screen is a big improvement for me. May not be valid for the ones who has used 5T or 6T in recent times)3. Still love the Oxygen OS with the add-on features4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. I'm using OnePlus Wireless Z earphones which connects to Nord quite fast compare to my 3T5. Design is good though I still love my Gunmetal design of 3T. Don't think any other latest 1+ phones can beat that design (just my perspective)6. Signal strength is good too. Don't have any problems with my cellular calls.7. 128GB storage is plus.8. Already received 2 updates within a week.Now coming to the cons -1. Camera set-up. I really don't like the design of ""Quad-camera"" set-up at all. The kind of audience they are targeting with Nord i think it would be much more appreciated if they just give 2 camera selection with some good image processing software.2. Now talking about image processing unit, they could have done better. I mean night images are okay but it could have been good. If they followed the simpler approach like pixel 4A I don't think anyone would buy Pixel unless someone is Pixel fanboy.3. Next thing speaker. Again this is decent mono speaker but they could have added stereo one instead of macro and useless lens. People like us we don't do macro photography and never going to do it with a phone but we will definitely watch some videos and songs on our phone. But don't take me wrong because quality of the speaker is good but it lacks the base. Compared with my wife's 1+ 6T (yeah we got 3 OnePlus phones and one earphone in our house)Summing up, 1+ Nord is a good budget phone for those who are planning to use it on day to day basis. Good screen, good battery life, decent camera and speaker will definitely justify the price. Having said that it would have been a real ""budget killer"" if OnePlus opts for two camera set-up with better quality and stereo speakers. My take if someone is really into mobile photography then wait for Pixel and buy that without any second thought. But if you want a good phone and ready to compromise the camera quality then look no further. Hope this helps. Cheers"
221,Raj,Not a good performer,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This review comes out after using the device for about 10 days and the performance is not good at all. I have been using Samsung & Huawei for so long and I didn't have any issues so far. This is my first product from One Plus and it's really something that everyone should think off.... this phone is really not worthy to spend.1. Touch response is not good2. Sometimes it's stuck for a sec or few millisecs3. Battery life if Okay4. Camera is good
222,Vivek,Big no for 1+ Nord..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are thinking of One plus Nord then don't think and compare with other phones. It's doesn't make sense to buy Nord. By buying this mobile, I have lost image on 1+. Even 10k mobiles have better camera than this. All camera's are useless just to have grainy pics. Back body is plastic. Also have heating issues. If think of replacement which will never happen so forget about replacement. Big no for 1+ Nord.."
223,Amogh Upadhyay,A good smartphone which could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Clean, functional design, infused with familiar OnePlus controls, like the Alert Slider.Super bright, accurate and smooth 90Hz OLED display, with HDR10+ support and clever auto refresh rate management.Optimal performance is extracted from the Snapdragon 765G chipset.Excellent battery life even in 90Hz mode.Competitive fast charging.Oxygen OS with more features than ever. Still one of the snappiest Android experiences available.Excellent main camera performance for the class.Cons:Plastic frame; dual selfie cam means a large punch hole.No 3.5mm audio jack, no microSD card slot and no notification LED.Single bottom-firing speaker with unimpressive performance.The 2x zoom is no match for a proper telephoto and the ultra-wide is barely satisfactory."
224,Raza,Very Important,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Huge Thanks to OnePluse because You provide us the mid-range 5G Phone, And Thanks Amazon to Service.Honest Review - I bought 12GB/256Rear Camera - 4/5Front camera - 3.8/5Battery Backup - 3.8/5Battery Charging - 3.8/5Display - 4/5Sound - 3.8/5 (Not Very Low)Charger - 4/5 ( Cable is Short )Fingerprint - 4/5Processor - 4/5 ( SD 765G Smooth for All)Android OS - 4.8/5 ( Impressive)Ram - 4.5/5 ( 12GB available may be 10GB )Rom - 256GBIf you really Loved OnePlus than go For it 12GB  variant Don't think Just Buy it, And Thanks again OnePluse and The Seller who Provided Fresh Handset Manufacturing Date is after 1 week when I order..."
225,C RAMAKRISHNA,Best Budget Phone with this price range with many different features...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after 1 week of use. First thing is impressed with design, so classy and premium look in hand. Screen-Its so smooth, thanks to 90Hz refresh rate and display is awesome. Camera-Pictures are so clarity with 48 MP sensor and selfie camera is superb. Battery-Coming to battery i am disappointed, its drowning very fastly with video calls and works for a day with normal usage, dint try with games yet, but 30W warp charger charges phone very fastly, which is time saving. Overall phone is awesome with this price range with many features, i can say go for it. Screen guard was pre-applied to the phone, but the phone cover which comes with box, when we fix phone in that, the screen guard is coming out as it was not placed exactly...Thank you One Plus for providing best budget phone in this price range.."
226,prakash,Bluetooth connectivity issues over.. software update waste... Same issue im facing..,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bluetooth issue overe..  no buying bro... First check Bluetooth connectivity... Next order this mobile...Im facing Bluetooth connectivity issues.. no standing Bluetooth connectivity.. worth this product 30000
227,Kamlesh PS,"Great phone, definitely consider buying it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone freezes and restarts about 15-20 times a day. It disrupts regular usage - if you're sending a mail or typing out a text, you have to start over again once it reboots. It's very annoying if you're watching something or listening to music or talking to someone. Sometimes it takes upto 20+ minutes to reboot.The screen has some tint issues. The left and right edges have a very obvious red tint to it and the center has a green tint. It's clearly seen against a grey / white background. There's also a distinct difference in the area around the camera.Oxygen OS is amazing, the customizability, UI and user experience is unmatched compared to other OS like MIUI Samsung OS. The quick launch feature is great, it saves a lot of time for things you use frequently.Battery life is great, it charges upto 100% in an hour (charging speed slows down around 70%). Device is very comfortable in the hand, fingerprint reader is easily reachable.Camera is great, night scape and pro modes are very useful while taking photos. The case that comes with the phone is also very good, it has raised corners to raise the screen and protect from scratches.The Amazon return procedure is trash. It asks you to install an app you can't even use. The only other way to return or replace it is to wait for a technician to assess the phone."
228,surya,A fluidic android experience :),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is great!!Love the looks and feel of the device.The user interface is so fluidic and nice. Oxygen OS coupled with the 90Hz OLED panel is the best thing ever.The speaker is fairly loud. The haptic feedback is good.Camera is good, not great. Sometimes you get really good images. Not a fan of the front camera as it makes the skin look too soft. Aggressive skin softening is an issue.The fingerprint scanner isn't the best thing. Sometimes it fails to read the print.Another issue I found is, it doesn't have an option to lock onto LTE network (only LTE/3G/2G option is available, no LTE only). Hence it often drops to 3G network at my place where the 4G signal is a bit weak. My moto g5 had no such issues though.To sum up, the phone is great!! Pretty gald I chose this device over the realme/redmi counterparts :)The software experience is far superior than any of those.Also got more than 4 software updates with many improvements over a month's time."
229,Rohan,Good mid-range smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord 12gb/256 versionDisplay- very good, 90hz is awesomeSoftware- top notch, flawlessCamera- the 48mp pics are very good, details are awesome, video recording is very nice with high stability... Front camera is good too...The wide angle camera in bad lighting had too much noise and macro camera isn't good unless you keep the phone very close to the object.Speaker- it's very loud compared to my old phoneBattery- if on 90hz then don't expect battery to last long, 60hz with normal usage you can get through the day... With gaming it will last 4hrs on average maybe a bit more... Anyways the warp charging is very good...Network- no issues as of nowMemory management- using the 12gb variant, it's managed multiple apps very nicely...Final say,If you are using a lower affordable range mobile (below 20k) and change to this, this mobile is heaven...If you have changed from mid range to this, don't not expect it to be the best, but it does do everything for its price range..If you changed from higher segment to this, idk why u did that...For this price range this phone has done good..."
230,RAJAT SURI,One plus is just a bliss go for it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earlier I was using Samsung a51 but I was not happy with the device due to horrible camera qualitySo I purchased one plus nord I have seen many negative reviews about camera in Amazon but I didn't find any negative about camera .camera is much much better than Samsung a51 so I am very happy with cameraProns-1. one plus brand hand in feel is so awesome it looks so beautiful2.Oxyzon os Samsung is no where near3. I personally found camera best under 30000 far better than Samsung A51 which cost 250004. Display 90hz refresh rate, I compare nord display with Samsung a51 Samsung was just laughing stock5. Charger is so fast within 30 min it will charge 60%6. No tint issue I faced stillCons- 1-battery drains very fast2. 3.5mm jack should have been givenOnly 2 issue I found for me it's bestI read many review that camera is showing bullery photosI did not face this issue front camera is bestSo go for it one plus is one plus no one is near"
231,Gokulkrishna P V,Tint Issue,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the phone on Aug 4 since I pre-booked on July 28. I was really happy to receive the phone that early while others where still waiting. Buy after few hours of usage, I was struck with the issue which can be seen below in these images. So opted for return. I tested most of the aspects before the return was picked.Camera is Good for a phone like this. I also didn't feel like using a OnePlus 8 cam. Maybe the image processing is different in this one?Battery is kinda okey, nothing to boast about. Moderate usage can give you upto one day backup.Now the good parts :Videos are quite good90Hz is nice to useBuild quality is pseudo premium!(The plastic border lowers our confidence)On screen Fingerprint sensor is fast and responsiveFront cam (main) is nice. Way better than OP 8Front wide angle gives soft images and is pretty bad at low light(Same with Rear Wide angle)Nightscape is great!Warp charging is the best!And Finally the OS! No words to express its awesomeness!"
232,Kuber,Affordable & Best Performance 5G mobile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Totally satisfied with product build quality, Performance & Sound, One plus delivered a good product in this price range. Thanks to Amazon for delivering the product in 4 days 😍😍Pros :1. value for money,2. Build quality, design was good.3. Very light weight & easy to carry, weightless4.

Gaming was superb, PuBg was smooth to play only in HD.Cons :1. No memory card for Extension of storage2. No 3.5mm audio jack, you have to buy Type C connector to audio output3. Battery capacity was low, it should be 4500 or 4700 mah, heavy usage it was last for one day only.4. PuBg was not available in UHD"
233,Pramit Bardhan,Bad Experience,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was expecting something good in this product, but it is a bad experience. This is the second handset i am using , first one I've returned because of some network, bluetooth and sensor issue.  Then again i ordered another one . I am using this handset from last 2 weeks , getting so many issues , like call recording, loudspeaker , bluetooth and sensor issue. Bluetooth issue is the main issue, where it disconnects automatically."
234,akr,Fantastic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Features I liked:1. Smooth Oxygen OS,2. Satisfactory performance of Main camera lens,3. Amoled display- always On display support,4. Feels premium in hand,5. OIS support in Camera,6. Warp charge7. No battery issues- easily last more than full day,8. Night mode in camera comparable to Gcam,9. 5G support,10. In display fingerprint sender smooth,11. Very good quality charger & cable.. Everything is good except below:1. No OnePlus dialer & messaging apps- The Nord has Google dialer, & Google Messaging apps.2. Difficulty in call recording- As there is no OnePlus dialer app, call recording is done using Google dialer app, which speaks loudly audible to both sides ""your call is being recorded"". Third party apps also don't support call recording in Android 10.3. Macro lens poor as of now, but hope to get better with future updates.4. Face unlock doesn't work in dark."
235,RANJEET SARKER,A Pro device for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This device feels like half the Samsung alike shell with Oneplus Feature sprinkles.My experience:1. Display: An appropriate size display with 90Hz Amoled. Display is quality enough match almost to flagship.2. Processor: Powerful enough to forget about flagship device is not my hand. With future proof 5G modem.3. Ram & Storage: With 12GB with 256GB enough for more than daily driver device.4. Camera: It is Midrange+ almost goes to OP8.5. Battery : More than 4000mah battery justify enough. At first battery draining going. But with updating update it got fixed.6. Price: At this price device seems a little much. For me I got Over+ budget price.7. Software: Oxygen os is the best skin you could in the market. And weirdly enough they exchanged from Dolby to Dirac Audio. It is good to stick with Dolby. With 3 years software support smooth & speaker sound is very good.Final thought : At this price enough of a device. It little hurts without the 3.5 mm jack. This device is already recommended to a friend.
236,Naik L,Well balanced and justified for 30k,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus NordIn my opinion, Nord is a very well balanced well structured phone that will give best results..and justified for 30k for 12GB/256GBAfter one week of my experience...... Here I listed some points which came in my mind....Pro's1. Fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate2. Oxygen OS...Bloatfree/Ad free/Clean/Smooth with regular bug fixes and atleast 2,3 years OS udpates3. Fingerprint Scanner (upto 5 can b registered)/Face Unlock are very very fast4. Camera....Full marks for OIS/EIS... With the help of these, it will take good and natural (not like other phones as filtered) images in day time and NightScape mode is good... 4K Video recording are too good in front and rear...and 4K 60FPS in front is very helpful for Vloggers5. Because of Gorilla Glass V5 in front and backside mobile will look catchy6. Light weight and easily can operate with single hand7. Alert Slider button is at its best8. No heating issue till now (doesn't tried high end games but if play mid level games for hour, it doesn't feel any heat)9. Fast Charging....53 min took for 100%10. No need to download any 3rd party app, these are came inbuilt only....Hidden Space (To hide an app), Lock Box (To hide any Videos, Images, Files etc), App Lock (To lock any apps), Parallel Space (To operate 2nd account) and Screen Recorder (To record screen operations in high quality)11. NFC, Cast Screen, Nearby Share options are there12. Several modes are there to help customization and battery optimization... Dark mode, Night mode, Reading mode, Zen mode, Bed time mode, Work mode, Life mode and Focus mode13. Inbuilt RAM optimisation is there14. Split Screen option is available15. SD 765 almost equally works like SD 8 seriesCon's1. Camera issues in low light2. Absence of stereo speaker and place3. Absence of 3.5 jack4. No external SD card slot5. Inbuilt dailer app (No automatic call record option if u record call a warning will goes to other side person...you cannot search a unknown number from dailing last digits in recent call list)6. Normal battery life....if you use heavy will get 5, 7 hrs SOT, otherwise easily come 1 or 1.5 day7. No notification indicator, but ambient display will help in that8. Absence of Dolby Atmos9. Plastic frame (But because of this phone feels light weight)10. Proximity Sensor is little slow (What i feel)11. After ending of incoming call , fingerprint doesn't work (2, 3 times only till now)12. Automatic Bluetooth connection problem (Sometimes)13. Some people complaining about Tint issue...but I didn't noticed14. Company saying 5G connectivity, but I dont think that it will not help now, because still 5G not rolled out in India"
237,Mukul,Camera quality poor,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Never could have thought that a phone by one plus that too launching in 2020 could be such a disappointment. Phone is ok in all aspects but it falls flat when it comes to camera . I can't believe how poor it is . I would suggest others to please take note before you think to buy this . Phone will perform as generally one plus phones does but camera quality will probably break your heart too.
238,aniket mishrikotkar,Probably the best daily driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its simply awesome. The device feels premium. Yeah there are issues with the battery and camera but I am sure those will be fixed in future updates. Warp charging is insane. So does the screen. Oxygen OS feels simple and elegant. Overall the phone is a great mid ranger. If they can fix all the issues in upcoming OTAs then it will be a huge success.
239,muzammil,Faulty product. No replacement,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Such a cheap product from one plus brandPhone is faulty and they dnt have a service center in my city.Instead of replacing , they are asking me to visit the service center which is in another city.This is insane.Why to ship to city, which has no service centres.Just grabbing customers money, zero service from Amazon and one plus.Amazon simply pushing it to one plus."
240,Amazon User,It's good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using the phone for a week. First two days, the battery used to drain pretty fast. I wasn't even using the phone continuously and was wondering if I got a faulty piece. But it got better now. I'm satisfied with the camera quality as well. I might not be able to give a proper explanation on pros and cons, but I assure you that it's worth the money."
241,Pradeep,"Delayed delivery, ordered on 28th July and received on August 12th",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is very good for my usage;  the battery is withstanding for around 1.5-2 days which is more than sufficient. Phone usage is very smooth and bloat-free. I am the kind of guy who installs all kinds of apps to try it out. Not a photo geek, so cannot review much on camera quality. If you are looking at a good budget phone with one plus branding go for it."
242,Aaron Chameilo,A GOOD BUY FOR THE WOKE CONSUMER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been on using this phone for a good two weeks now and have been following every issue and product review of this phone including going through the entire Amazon section review for this phone. And my opinion boiling down being that OnePlus Nord is a good reliable phone. It won't fetch the highest benchmark scores or blow you away with any exceptional feature, that's a given. However, the experience is as promised with Oxygen OS onboard and the over-all performance you get out of this phone will not disappoint if you have your expectations calibrated to the price and the hardware that the Nord packs. The price point that the Nord comes at is in a sensitive range with a full spectrum of higher spec'd phones and excellent one trick-ponies in this range to the Nord, but it should also be remembered that Nord was never intended to be a Spec Beast nor deliver anything particularly exceptional, but rather it was tailored to the point to deliver the optimal OnePlus experience within the aforementioned price range. The optics, display, built and all other aspects have been all accounted for within my period of usage and I have 10/10 faced each pro and con respectively, except for extreme cases of defunct or flawed pieces..A general rule of thumb to also remember being that users moving in from higher end phones with an exceptional quality or feature will most definitely see the non-flagship performance of the Nord and that people moving to the Nord from lower end phones will also most definitely too experience everything in new light in lieu of the upgrade, so it would be good remember the conditionality of instance being reported from users..The OnePlus Nord is a good phone and it delivers fully according to its capabilities. Nothing is exceptional but nothing is garbage. Except for the 2MP rear Macro Cam sadly haha but that being said is foresable given the mixed bags that companies have to pick and choose from. I'm most happy with how the Nord functions and in absolute tune with the reality of what the Manufacturers intended to deliver to us users. Solid 9/10 for what it is was intended to be..P.S. People Concerned about the Green Tint and Display Issues should definitely check out KDCloudy's video on YouTube about the ""OnePlus Nord/OnePlus 8 Pro Display Issues"". It does a good job in explaining the nuances of the whole fiasco being faced."
243,Sagar Sanap,Best midranger at this moment,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The OnePlus Nord feels premium to touch and the weight is well-balanced. The handset is easy to grip and feels very compact to hold. Camera bump is huge, frame is plastic but doesn't feel like it.There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack so had to purchase a Bluetooth headset worth 2k.OnePlus retains the slider button however it's not being used as WFH.OnePlus seems to have made no compromise with the display, a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. Having said that, the device feels a bit longish and it will take some to get used to the form factor.It’s a delight to watch movies or stream content on the device. The colours are vivid but sunlight legibility is no good even with max brightness.The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors. The front camera produces good quality selfies.The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest in the business.About the performance, this device does well when it comes to gaming (CODm) and multitasking. While gaming, expect the device to get warm but it will not slow down the phone. Overall, the device manages to offer a smooth experience without any software hiccups or app crashes. For average users, who are into occasional gaming, the Nord will easily take care of all your performance demands.The WarpCharge 30T is a delight as you can get around 50% battery time by charging the battery for 25 minutes and reaches 100% within an hour for me. Battery lasts longer, refer the screenshots (taken over a month since I got the phone).The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.I got it for 26.5k with HDFC discount on Prime Day sale and at this price it's a value for money purchase."
244,Mahesh.P,It is a good daily driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's one of best phones available in the market at this price.But there are some pros and cons on this which I will be discussingPros:1.The software experience is one of the best in this price it's best after the stock android oxygen os is best.2.The display is best on this phone it's amoled display with 90 Hertz it's very smooth.3.The battery performance is very good on this device it will not disappoint you it's very it's 4415 amh battery and then comes the fast charge 30t it's one of the best charges the in less than 70 min.4.The haptics are very good on this device the touch sampling rate is very good.5.Camera performance is good but their are some cons which I will be discussing later on the primary and ultra wide cameras are good.6.Then the speakers are good on this device all though it's not stereo speakers the sound is very but not so clear.Cons:1.The first con is camera though it has very good night scape and primary and ultra wide camera but their are two cameras at bottom one 5mp depth which is not working and 2mp macro camera which is pretty useless and not of use it is very disappointing part of the phone.Their are doing a lot of gimmick of quad camera but we are only using first two cameras I was not expecting this from OnePlus this was very disappointing.But if you use OnePlus bullet wireless Z it's very good which I am currently and I One Plus buds will also work good with this device.2.Then their is no 3.55mm headphone jack as they are saying this a budget but not having headphone jack this is very disappointing as they have sell one plus buds they didn't gave 3.55mm jack it's all marketing crap of their own products.3.Then if you are a gamer I would not suggest you this phone as this device sucks in pubg it's not at all good as compared to its competitors like k20pro.So don't buy this device for gaming you will be disappointed.So that's all it's a very good device at this price point and it's future proof also as its has 5g compatibility so a very good daily driver.
245,Vishesh mehta,Disappointing ! Bad camera bad battery !,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  A very poor product from one plus , the battery drains very fast , the warp charger is not so fast . The camera whichbis the highlight of this phone is the real dissaponment . The back camera clicks shaky pictures 8 out of 10 pict are blurry . I was using mi note 8 pro before this on the same usage I had 45% battery left in it by the end of the till 9pm . The one Nord died at 5pm . It's a let down I think Goole 4a would have been a better choice . Really disappointed with the product . Wanted to return it . No return policy only replacement available ."
246,Ashish,This phone is superb but missing some trademark features of One Plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Purchased One Plus Nord 12 +256 varient.The phone looks classy and premium.Voice quality is superb. The processor speed is amazingly fast and it should be with 12 gb.Already got 2 updates which claims to improve battery efficiency and macro picture quality.Yes,the battery drains little bit faster but it gets charges exceptionally fast so no regrets.it charges to 80% within 45 mins. camera is much better in selfie and for close pictures.detailings are also fine.Night mode is little bit average but overall if u compare in such range then it's far better than others.In my view it is a good choice to buy this phone in 30k bucks.you are getting everything which is in one plus 8 and even more if u talk about camera.Only thing the basic screen while calling and some other basic things which are trademark of one plus is changed...it should be there.the oxygen OS is great and will be best if u give everything which is available in one plus series oxygen OS."
247,Amazon Customer,Good Android experience with avg camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  They really hyped this particular model. I bought it in prime day sale. I was using Galaxy S9 earlier so I was happy with Oneplus android experience since it's near to stock android experience, not big fan of customized UI since they add so many bloatware.But for this price range, I am not happy with the camera, the post-processing of the image really takes away the sharpness of the photo, and it does not look clear, I tried with both 12MP and 48 MP but results are almost same.Regarding the screen tint issue, Yeah I noticed it only during the night time when the brightness was almost 0 and screen refresh rate is 90hz and the background is totally black, if you change it to 60Hz then you won't see that also, so I won't say it is an issue. I did not observe it throughout the day.Battery life is good and charging is so fast.So Overall it is a good phone but if you are looking for good quality photography then I won't recommend it."
248,Anusree,A good value for the money with an average camera and questionable battery performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't know what to feel about the phone. It is a comfortable mid Ranger and definitely a run for your money if you want the right things. This maynot be the one for you if you need a good lense or if you need a super fast processor. It provides an alrighty experience and is certainly better than a lot of the other mid rangers and even expensive iphones.But I do have some problems. I am not a fan of any one plus cameras and this is no exception. Camera is just average. If you need a good camera, maybe you should wait for the pixel 4a. Pixel cameras are the best in the market.Another problem I have is with the battery. I saw multiple reviews claiming that it has a good battery compared to other mid rangers and some expensive samsung phones. But I cannot feel it. I feel like it's draining so fast, I should keep checking it and see if it's really not standard."
249,Anuj,Gratest failure of OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery Heating issue, Camera is no way near the flagship. Even my OnePlus 6t is way better with just 2 +1 cameras. Quality of video streaming is pathetic. Audio through built-in speaker is bas and through earpieces are worst. In short, OnePlus nord is no probably the gratest failure of OnePlus brand. Other models of OnePlus are way way better."
250,prakash Akerkar,Worth Buying Oneplus Nord in mid range segment !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well I am not so much techy guy who can answered all detailed query but i would like to write my honest review about this phone. I was definitely waiting for this Nord (which was rumored as oneplus Z) from March. First will talked about its packing -- Its awesome !!! Device comes in black box embedded with Nord logo...very fascinating.Then comes to display - 90Hz AMLOED smooth and refreshing colors. No issue observed about display which was rumored to be have color fade issue  dark mode. So guys dont worry !! If you worrying about display no issue from device as per my opinion.  Oxygen OS best user experience. Camera - Front and Rear Primary camera both are excellent , with coming update it will enhance. Macro 2MP - Not that much good. Speaker - Mono but still serve the purpose ; sound is good. Gaming experience - smooth no glitches experienced, PUBG user may have different view based on experience. Looks - Its cool, you will not come to know the back cover is of fiber unless said. So overall experience with this budget phone 9/10. if you really want to buy it then Go FOR IT !!!  You will enjoy the feeling"
251,Shubham,Nord - Story of a complete phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am not a tech reviewer but I am someone who has used this phone for good 15 days.Phone has got- Superfast Charging (5% -100% in around 70 mins) - if you say there are phone with better charging speed, sure there are, but what's the problem with this, we are charging phone not participating in race and if you do not have like 1 hour of off screen time then it's not the fault of charging speed surely you need to change your lifestyle.- Processor (does all the task smoothly, from small day to day task to playing high ends games)- Ram Optimization (switching between app is like cake walk for this phone)- Fingerprint (it's fast but could have been a little bit more snappier,  I could notice only because my last phone sensor has a better response but that harldly makes any difference)- OS(it's one of the USP of OnePlus, very user friendly and interactive)- Backup (on my off day my avg uses are like 3-4 games of PUBG, 1-1½ hrs of voice/video call, 3-4 hours of Net Surfing/YouTube/social media, 3-4 hours of HotSpot tethering,  with such uses device keeps me going through out the day.)- Display - 90hz display surely makes the difference- Camera - does the job beautifully- Looks Premium - glass back panel and it's colour set it's apart"
252,Irshad C A,OnePlus impressed me this time also,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm really impressed this time also.... My Last phone was oneplus 3 it was amazing buy i really like this time Nord. Will tell you my few suggessios.--------------Pro:*Good camera phone (you can compare with oneplus 8) . Impressed in outdoor picture performance*Good performance*Nice design*Video quality is pretty good*Oxygen is the best*Stunning display ( I didn't face the tint problem ... I'm confirmed)*Descent performance when u play game.*Decent battery performance*Built quality is impressed----------------Cons*Low light camera has bit grains ( but it's not that much bad)*Gaming performance is good but can't compare with other oneplus phones ( we can't compare with 765G chip with 865 ... Look at the price difference also)*No headphone jack ( I'm really disappointed with this)------Note: You can't compare with High range oneplus Phone with this phone performance but compare with camera its pretty good . Note the price difference between other oneplus phones you can understand.
253,Stranger,Value for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you love OnePlus, go for it..you will not get disappointed..I didn't saw any tint issue while 2 days of usage.. ofcourse the competition models are giving better specs, but this is the most compact..loving it..camera is okay compared to others in my opinion"
254,Adarsh Singh,Balanced upper mid-range device with flagship Oxygen OS,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's a balanced package guy's.An excellent device for daily usage.A decent device for gaming as well as camera.I think camera should be improved in coming future through OTA's.Overall 4.5/5 from my side :-)
255,seno,"An awesome, decent and budget mobile.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  A decent phone with smooth performance. I am not a heavy user of games, movies etc. This phone met most of my needs. Video quality and stabilisation are excellent. Pictures are good. Grey onyx look is amazing. Charging speed is extraordinary. I have not faced any tint issue. Overall I am satisfied. Should see if it stands amazing for longer time with no issues.Cons : I have faced the screen getting into so much dust.. like a dust magnet."
256,Shresth Gupta,Best phone And worth phone in the range of 30K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  • Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is average.macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is good.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it.*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)"
257,Kunal Biswas,Nice handy phone but issue in images,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It's good phone for regular uses. Os is great. 90 hz display is great. But I don't like camera performance. It's so much colorful. Extra color in everywhere. I like natural color. And it also produce shakey images if you click and shake hand in a second. But other than this the phone is nice choice.
258,Manpreet Singh,Not Satisfactory Phone,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hello ALl,i purchased this phone of top varient with 12GB RAM and 256 GB ROM. However, phone's performance was not satisfactory. After my data transfer from old phone I started to use it full fledged. With no games and no movies watching and using the phone for youtube, facebook and office emails battery did not lasted for more than 8-10 hours. Fast charging was working though, but then i need to plugin again and again. It started to give me worries when during the phone calls when i used to receive, it did not worked well. either it was a UI problem or something, but there i saw performance lag while picking up a call or disconnecting it.I liked the camera though, it was good and it gave me overall satisfaction. Heating issues also was observed. Overall I was still happy with my old phone even though it has a bit of performance issue.So i decided to return the phone which I am not satisfied with."

I have always been fond of one plus phones and their processors . Talking about 3.5 mm jack , then i dont feel the difference of it as most of the people today are using wireless earphones or head phones or airpods soo I dont feel the difference of not having 3.5 mm jack . Its a decent phone at this price with good performance for daily use . I m not a gaming person soo it hardly makes a difference whether Pubg or any game is good or not as havent tried pubg on this but overall this phone is good as compared to realme and xiomi"
263,Aarti Gupta,#amazonshowedtruecolour#Oneplusnorddontbuy,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Please dont buy this product.. camera is worst...

265,Piyush,ONEPLUS NORD - WORST PHONE EVER,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The worst phone ever with worst camera quality, not a single percent worthy. Redmi cameras are way better than this ONEPLUS NORD. Its not worth the amount. Nrver ever go for purchasing this, humble request to all the people planning to purchase ONEPLUS NORD.Even amazon policy is not at all good, they apply dual policy with customers, while purchasing they have one policy and after purchase a different one."
266,Suchdeep,Product is good but expected more from One plus,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Had bought it in pre sale, received on 2nd August.Had issues with Calling, the call was getting dropped randomly, solved by turning off Wifi Calling in the SIM Settings, but this problem wasn't being faced in previous phone, only faced it in this One plus.Also the Camera quality isn't that great as you expect from One plus, but the cost is also less so can't say more."
267,PS SIVA,"Epitome of Android device, otherwise buy iOS devices with your hard earned money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this because other Chinese offerings started to bake advertisements into operating systems giving you the message that "" nothing is free, you pay for watching ad"". Other options were iphone ( super stretch of budget for me and cost of accessories can get you another ad phone). I am a person who strictly believe that you shouldn't pay more than 35k for an leaky android considering what IOS and even a 3yr old iphone has to offer. So finally settled for OnePlus nord given the hardware at this price point : ad free Oxygen OS, SD 765 5G, 90hz led panel, opted for 8gb since ram is an old lpddr4x and not 5, decent cameras front and back, 30 watt fast charging, finally an accurate gps with NAVIC, decent haptics. Note : finally once again started to get notifications, better memory management, quality sensors like proximity, gps, no call drops with clarity calling,  after I ditched samsung a long time back for an Chinese cheapo due to the lags. Feels like quality samsung hardware with Chinese cheapos speed ( thankyou Oxygen os )."
268,DARPAN ,"Great phone, read the review.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"   Great phone by OnePlus. Amazing budget. Compared the Camera with an existing OnePlus phone, did not get me happy at all. The difference between the quality of the photos could be clearly seen. I don't know if OnePlus tried to fool us, but if you check the manufacturer : it's OPPO. And I could definitely say that the camera quality could be like OPPO less like OnePlus. The Camera is great though, it's not like you wouldn't have good pictures, you could create great pictures if you've already bought the phone or if you are going to buy it, please go for it without a doubt. It's an amazing phone with excellent features which would keep you interested in it for a long time."
269,hardik,Review for Normal User!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Here's my honest review if you're a normal user-I'm a working professional who doesn't do much gaming. Trust me guys this is the best phone you can buy.Sexy look!Awesome speed- you'll feel this everytime u use this phone.Camera is goodBattery is superb! If u keep refresh rate at 60 u ll get very goooood backupWhat else u need in day to day life from a phone?
270,Manpreet Singh,Very Poor display quality TINT in normal use also,1.0 out of 5 stars,  On normal usage mostly while the screen is white then while we shift our viewing angles there is a red-purplish-green tint which can be seen in my Oneplus nord with naked eyes that is very much annoying and one can not live with such a major defect so I decided to replace it as the phone is very gud in other aspectsI am still willing to buy it but I am confused that was that a issue with my phone only or it is a normal issue in everyone’s phone in every unitAnd yes the screen guard which came pre applied was also not attached properly it had many dust particles in it ONEPLUS should improve the product quality
271,Noddy,Smooth & Snappy - Happy with the product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros- Highly responsive as it has 90Hz refresh rate- Option of 12gb RAM- Decent Camera- On screen fingerprint reader which is quick- Stylish look- Fast ChargingCons- Battery drains lil quickly, but fast charging helps- Low lighting picture quality could be improved- Macro lens is useless"
272,ASISH K.,Call drop issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I purchased 2 phones and both the phone had hardware issue i.e. calls were getting dropped continuously. Tech team checked and the issue was hardware. Both my phones were refunded rather than exchange. Highly disappointed. I wish OnePlus had done network testing with all the potential network providers. May be some network providers are not compatible or do not support 5G. Serious issue to be checked.
273,Manu jose,Good package.. good user experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks promising.Pros.1. Snapdragon 765 works like a breeze.2. Software is well optimized for hardware.3.

Touch response, display are good.9. 30w charging is excellent no issues( only work  with the supplied charging cable)Cons.1. Macro camera is useless.2. Call recording feature is available but useless. It  plays a sound "" your call is being recorded""  when we hits recording button. Audible to  other person clearly. No auto call recording  feature.( People argue that this can be fixed  with software patch, but in case of nord one  plus won't change this google restrict the  removal of call recording notification sound.)3. Display is good but when u were using samsung  mid range before, u will feel that display is not  at par with samsung.4. No headphone jack (not a con) but oneplus type  c to 3.5 mm converter is out of stock always.  Other adapters available in online doesn't  work properly(significant loss of audio quality).Apart from this a minor bluetooth issue is there with nord. While using wifi and bluetooth headset simultaneously bluetooth headset will disconnects and reconnects automatically.( One plus promised update to fix the glitch)"
274,Sarju donga,Its a nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  So after 15 days of usage here is my review1.battery life is very good lasts one day easily after heavy use charging is very fast may take 45 min.2. Screen resolution is good camera is decent3.phone is slim and comfortable in holding hands4.oxygen os is very good till date I am using stock android phone but oxygen os is also user friendly.5.this phone have many inbuilt features which are lack in stock android.6.only draw back is automatic call recorder is not available but you have to record calls manually7.sound quality of speaker is good and loud.Final words if you are looking for good budget 5g ready phone than go for it without hesitation.
275,Alok,Phone is having network issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using Jio as my primary network in my Oneplus Nord for a week. Most of the time there is a network problem. The sim shows full network but Net is not working properly. I have to turn on to airplane mode and then turn off to get the network again. Please solve this issue. I am getting this problem only in this phone
276,Somnath,Balanced package of everything,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after using it for complete 8 days -Keeping it simple by asking you a question. What are your priorities ?There are many competitors to nord but none of the phones are a complete package.1) The processor 765G work great when optimised with Oxygen OS.2) Amoled display is phenomenal with 90hz refresh rate, fingerprint reader got no complains.3) Battery life is great (with my usage screen on time was 8-9hours) easily goes a day.4) Warp charging (full charge at 59minutes).5) Camera quality is not that great as the macro lens should have been skipped, but if compared to other phones at this price it gives a tough competition to other phones available in India right now (attached is a nightscape shot).6) Speaker should have been stereo but the mono down facing speakers are quite loud and produces crisp sound.7) Oxygen OS (big thumbs up).8) You don't need to worry about the build (as no one snaps a phone like Jerry does in daily usage), also it is quite rigid and weight is equally balanced.This is my first One Plus phone and I would say the experience is very good. I believe that this phone is a complete package by balancing every aspect for a daily driver. It does not have one specific thing as ""the best"" but every other thing as the second best, which adds to what a complete package should be.- Not a pro gamer, but someone who uses every function of a phone roughly."
277,reshma r.,Slightly disappointed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am not much happy with this purchase. The camera is one highlighted feature of OnePlus and I am highly disappointed about the same, there is nothing which standout in camera in this phone. Macro as already known is pathetic. Also photos when captured tend to be shaky and blurred at times, quality.of pics does not meet expectations. So ya after spending 28k on this phone, with the features that I have got I am not happy. But ya if you wanna go for the brand then ya you will get a OnePlus phone, but do not expect much out of camera quality"
278,Neeraj,Good budget 5G enabled phone but bit over priced.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Oxygen 10.5 OS is good and m waiting for 11 to be available for Nord.First hand experience is good and phone feels awesome in hands. Back color (Marbel Blue is odd one out) and side bars of platic don't feel like it's a plastic and gives you illusions of metal.Good to see they provide back cover along with box.You get extended warranty for red club membership on pre-orders.Camera is good but not good enough to meet the hype one plus Nord had made before launch.30watt wrap charger is good to charge the phone within an hour but battery brick is low on capacity. It would have been great if they would have provided 5000-6000mah battery. Battery management is good and have lots of options to save battery but that will reduce you premium experience.
279,Manoj,Worst Camera Performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered it on July 28th and received it on Aug 9th. Promised delivery date was Aug 4th. Nearly delivery delayed 5 days I didn't even get any intimation from Amazon.Here is my experience:I upgraded from Mi A3 to Nord, Mi A3 has far better front camera than Nord. I'm just wondering how I'm gonna get use of 4k recording with such a terrible front camera.Wide angle and Macro lenses are useless.Battery drains so fast even if you with 60Hz refresh rate.Few Good thing with phone is Smooth user experience, quickest fingerprint and face unlock.Think wisely before you buy"
280,shubhi,One plus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is not that good.. The battery works for 18-20 hrs only from 100% charge even when we don't use much social networking sites. It drains quickly.Camera clicks with good pixels only in daylight otherwise in dim lights it will give little grey colours. Portrait and nighscape modes are awsome.And apart from this, it is very very smooth to use"
281,Samir Baruah,Excellent phone for daily usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a user friendly, a value for money product. This is not the best or the worst , but definitely a very good phone. The display of the phone is amazing. I don't find any tint issue here. I have been using this phone for more than a week and the system is working fine. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock functions are very effective just like any other one plus device. Battery life may not be exceptionally good but for me one full day is enough. And of course charging is very fast. Camera quantity is good. However, macro camera is useless and in low light condition it's result is average. In broad daylight, the camera of this phone plays the masterstroke. Over and above, this is a good phone at this price range. I am happy with the purchase of One plus Nord."
282,Pavvivizag,"Great performance, well built, camera with ois, great display 90hz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"   The best you can get. Good price , great performance. The gaming performance is exceptionally good compared to any midrange smart phones. Display is amazing. Form factor and finish are up to the mark. Only complaint i have is with the quad camera setup.the primary camera (48mp) is the only good camera with ois, the macro 2mp is just useless. Only reason you want to choose oneplus over an mi phone is the UI."
283,Jay,Write a review after one month.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except camera, Everything is perfect for me. As I am just a normal user. Not playing gaming so much,so good phone for me. But as described, a flagship level camera, it is not as expected. Otherwise battery backup is good. Not experienced any leg. Neat and clean UI is best part of this master piece. Received 3 updates till the date in just one month. Very impressive. Oneplus try hard to improve quality of camera pictures by giving updates. But still not found any notable improvement. Hope in future updates, camera quality improved more."
284,Subrat,DEFECTIVE SCREEN,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   after using for 7-8hrs the screen got glitches all over the screenand also the shipping package wasn't packed with damage proof cartoon box, it was just the phone under the plastic cover, even the edges of the phone box were damaged."
285,shiva sai Mylarapu,Perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The performance, speed and style of the phone are awesome. Only dissatisfaction is battery draining a little faster than expected"
286,Amazon Customer,Worst mobile by Oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am OnePlus fan since launch of one plus one, but I had very bad experience this time with Nord. Very poor quality, camera is worst, sensor not working properly, charging issues, Display stopped working with in 7 days. I asked for help from Amazon prime but they said they can't help me , contact nearby service center. I went to service center, they said they will change this defective product and will give me new phone with in 5days, but after 10days  I got call that OnePlus company cannot change my device, I have to suffer with this poor quality product.My personal advice to all customers , Don't go with this project it's completely Chinese and useless. It's just waste of your precious money. Instead of OnePlus go for samsung."
287,Sagmax,OnePlus Nord best in Midrange,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing review after almost 10 days of use. Ordered on 6th Aug delivered on 8 th Aug, Good service by Amazon.Not comparing with any other phone just sharing my observations.12GB RAM and 256 GB storage and snapdragon processor so no problem with performance, AMOLED display and nice touch screen, feel good in hand.Camera quite good, on user recommendation Oneplus provided updates to improve vibrancy and accuracy of macro camera. As I am not expert of this department but completely satisfied with picture quality.Battery is 4115 mAh, which I think should be more but it last long for day with moderate to high use like 5-6 mail accounts, music, video, calls etc.. Not tried any games.Warp charging 4% - 100% in 70 minutes. Fast isn’t it? I observed battery drain almost 4%-6% during night without any use. Nord user asked Oneplus to resolve battery drain issue, hope they will soon provide patch to mitigate this.Oneplus provided lots of feature in this phone which are very handy, It is 5G enable but no use for now.Overall happy with Nord.If you have budget upto 30K I will recommend this phone.(Though you will get replacement of items but please read return and replacement policy of Amazon 2 times before ordering anything, it is not same as it was before.)"
288,Amazon Customer,Best mid-ranger with descent camera and good battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First Amazon return policy is fraud ,they closed return window in 4 days. So take careNord box look cheaper not like 28 k phonesHere's my review after 20 daysDesign:. handy lightweight and slim. Nothing more nothing less and good lookingDisplay: clear and brighter screen with good viewing angles.And tint issue is real, but not seen in normal usage.Back Camera: main camera capture good picture and vedios in day light condition. Night mode super. All other camera need improvement, macro and depth sensor is very bad wide angle camera goodDepth sensor sometimes struggled with cropping background.Indoor image qwality not bad.latest update done some improvements and need moreFront camera: not like 32 mp need improvement.updates clear noises but not goodBoth Front and back vedio qwality is super. Optical image stabilisation is goodBattery: good battery backup with almost 1 days in normal usage after update (90hz)Performance: smooth and lag free. No network issueOs: no ads no unwanted appsFinger print reader unlock fast. Face unlock very very fastCon: no headphone jackCon: little over priced. I think 25k is okI chose Nord because this divise very comfortable to hold and great os with flagship camera performance (little disappoinment with camera). I think more updates coming to fix that"
289,bimin,don't go fot it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  1+ is not a top quality phone to compare with i phone or sony.just like vivo /oppo.video clarity is good but photo not as expected.touch is not accurate..periodically this is shutdown automatically .heat issue in just a half hour use.little bit hang up for opening ,to compare with i phone /sonyAnd mainly one thing it's service center utterly flop,those who are depends vytla kochi, don't go for to buy 1+.they are very arrogant and bad behaviour, its service cost is very high,take a long time."
290,Rahul kumar ranjan,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a cool,classy and totally a one hand usable phone. Not with a big bulcky screen n weight, according to me it's the only phone with these hypnotizing looks in the blue colour in this price range. Camera and ram management is above the marks obviously but battery is just descent not that much gud not too bad.Looking for a classy phone under 30k so go for it."
291,vishal,Loudspeaker bursting .. disappointed.. received one plus nord with defect,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Have got a new one plus nord a week late.... And loudspeaker needs repair.It's sound is bursting.And I am struggling finding the one plus service center..Dint expect this in a new product . Highly disappointed.
292,Arun l.,Premium feeling with satisfied features,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honest review after 2 weeks of use. Absolutely an amazing and premium phone at this range. There have been lots of comparison and negative reviews about OnePlus Nord, but for me it's the best smartphone packed with balanced features. No other phones gives u premium feeling as OnePlus Nord at this range. Battery life, camera quality and performance all well above average and not to forget the quick warp charge that adds to the boost. And it is getting even better with updates, thanks to OnePlus and it's software oxygen os, highly recommend guys. If you think other phones gives u better performance, don't forget they charge you extra cost also."
293,Ashok Ramakant,Great phone with a few hiccups,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great looking phone. I never thought I would ever own a blue coloured phone, but this color looks really goodScreen tinting / rainbowing is definitely present at low brightness but didn't really bother me. The screen is gorgeous otherwiseThe charging is super fast, and I was quite taken aback by how quickly it went from 0 to 100pct.4g reception is amazing. My previous phone struggled to get a strong signal in several areas of the house, but the strong attenna on the Nord seems to pick up nearly full strength everywhereThe OS has a few bugs unfortunately, more than I expected based on the brand, coming from a Mi phone before this. For example:* By default the alarm volume was set up at 10pct for some reason and I almost missed my work meetings the day after I got this phone* Enabling and disabling Do Not Disturb mode leaves the ringer volume at zero percent, which meant I missed a few important calls even though my phone was not on DnD/silent. You have to manually increase the ringer volume even after disabling DnD. The OnePlus forums show many others facing this issue* Bunch of other bugs related to thisMakes me wonder what else"
294,Prashant Yadav,Nord post 10 days performance review.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using this phone for more than 10 days now i beleive i had tested it enough to share my verdict,It's overall a good experience using this phone with one of the best part is display and bad part is aswell (pointing tint issue in very low light) the interface is clean and smooth but there is definately connectivity issue with jio sim but it happened only twice in 10 days.No lag issue faced till now.Camera is improved after update (macro is such a waste)Warp charger is superr..Overall its good buy for day to day user to a moderate gamer."
295,Amazon Customer,Bad,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life is very bad plz OnePlus fix the issue
296,Dhikshit,Decent buy for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good productI can give below ratings for the featuresPerformance 4/5Camera 4/5Display and build 4.5/5Battery 3.5/5Decent product at this cost when compared to iPhoneOnePlus should at least provide ear phone connector with the phone since it doesn't have separate port for earphones. This product doesn't come with earphones
297,NIKHIN CC,Budget phone at a good price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would say it's a budgest phone for daily use. Performance wise it's really a good phone at this budget especially the refresh rate,  Amoled display and the Oxygen OS. Coming to the cons, Firstly, the camera is not upto the mark. Oneplus has not maintained the camera quality in this Nord segment. Secondly, the battery drains like anything. If you are using mobile data then don't expect your battery for a long duration. Full charge happens in 20 to 30 mnts. Apart from battery and camera, I am happy with the phone. May be will have to give a review in future depending on the observations."

299,Jigar Chheda,If Camera is not primary go for it.... Smart buy..,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Brought this phone on Prime day and got delivered in 2 days, since 5 days I am using this phone.Pros-1 - Light Weight2 - Super Fast3 - Very extensive use battery last for the day also with fast charge.4 - Touch5 - Single Speeker but sound is loud6 - Oxygen OSCons -1 - Camera 📸2 - if you use for game it tend to get Warm3 - Fast charge till 70% after 70 - 100% it take time.4 - Plastic body5 - Sometimes touch couldn't respond from different angle.Overall a good phone, looks premium but camera is main drawback, rest all is superb."
300,Anonymous007,Worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The majority of peole say the speaker is not good. I used to own an Asus zenfone 5z with stereo speakers, and this speaker is very loud, perfectly suited to loud Indian scenarios.I'm not fond of taking much photos, so the camer's pretty decent for me. Other than that, everything else works like a charm.Some people are saying the fingerprint sensor is slow. Bruh, it's an under display sensor. As compared to other phones with the same sensor, it's one of the fastest.The face-unlock feature is very reliable. It easily unlocks the phone even if you are in a completely dark room.The battery drains a bit fast, considering the fact that it's above 4k maH. But the 30watt charging more than just makes up for it.It comes with a factory fitted screen guard, which covers the entire phone, so there's no tension of buying one.The volume rockers and the other buttons are very clicky, and extremely responsive.And then there's Oxygen O.S.I would say it's a good bang for the buck."
301,Tejas Gorde,"Oxygen OS awesome, But mobile has some cons",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hello team,Mobile is overall good. Oxygen OS is awesomeBut following are the Cons :-my one plus nord Mobile battery drained in 8-10 hours with  just a normal use with actual mobile usage time 2-3hours.Auto brightness Functionality sometimes adjust the brightness to very low level eventhough slightly more brightness is needed for normal use. Auto brightness adjustments does not reach to require brightness at many scenarios in daily use. so I need to to turnoff auto brightness and keep the brightness to normal requirements.I hope that you will address the mentioned issues."
302,Amazon Customer,Read before you buy oneplus nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I think i might have been handed a defective device by seller rocket kommerce llp.Preordered it that was amazon gimmick and fooled me before i could read somebody else review like this.Rear camera pics have heavy color distortion. And battery bakup is down right pathetic. No games installed whatsoever but still the device does not last even 18 hours on full charge with just moderate use whatsapp and instagram. Tried contacting amazon but no use. Asked them to get me in touch with seller i.e rocket kommerce llp but no help. amazon said they dont have the seller information, contact,email anything. A seller using their platform and amzon dont have the details strange or just avoiding.?"

It is hard to find type c audio head set in market."
304,satwik,One of the best in its segments,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all no phone is perfect.. so don't bother about negative reviews..Nord is much more than everything.Battery draining is somewhat hight but here there is Warp charge 30T to charge it up very fast.And reffresh rate is everything.. even in 60hz it works very fine, no need to go for 90hz until there are more heavy apps to handle...Camera is good at its segment, if u look at another phones of 64MP Nord is the beast..And gaming performance is satisfactory for a everyday gamer.. but if u are a competitive gamer being a 765g it will be not up to the mark.Optimization is very fineGo for it guys if you love OnePlus and it's Oxygen OS"
305,Vishwas,Great device with right balance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is an overall great package with some compromises to cut corners from the flagship device to save cost. It is evident from the plastic frame which is considered to be less premium but might be a good thing considering it offers better durability in terms of real world use cases when the phones get dropped. Battery life is average with screen on time of 6-7 hours and charging speed of 2%/min which charges the phone upto 60% in 30 min at its peak. Performance is great and casual gaming should be no problem. Camera is really great if you use GCAM installed as can be seen from samples. Software experience is great and there is gauranteed updates for next 3 years which is a must for longevity of the device. The screen is great and offers fluid experience. The phone overall experience is positive with minor hiccups like stock camera app performance, gimmicy quad camera setup(Useless macro camera and depth camera), no headphone jack and above average battery backup."
306,Amazon Customer,Disappointed with NORD,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's my 2nd one plus device. I was using 5T and made mistake of buying nord. It's been 7 days of usage and it has already started getting hanged while watching videos, connecting on conference call and while taking calls when connected to bluetooth device. If you are using OP device already and want to upgrade then buy 7 or 8."
307,Jobin,Pretty good for the price!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a good phone in this price range. The user experience is amazing. The display is top notch at reasonably low brightness too. They might fixing the black crush issues in the display in the newer manufactured phones. The photos taken by the phone were very underwhelming. After the system update it got better but was still a bit soft where there should sharp details. The photos are usable now and the camera software being coninuously bein updated means it's only going to get better. The only weird thing are the volume rockers. I find them interfering when using the phone normally in my hand but that might be because I have pretty big hands. It should be okay for medium to small hands. I would definitely recommend this one!
308,Anoop,Not worth its price,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yes, the mobile is not its worth 27,999rs  + Amazon Prime 129/month subscription* Ordered on Aug 4th 2020, delivered on 19th Aug 2020, with valid Prime membership* Go for Redmi mobile which will cost just 15-17k* Camera at its worst.  It is as worst as the basci android mobile which you get for 10000rs. Expectation was more for this range and from One plus brand*brand value doesnt exist*there is only one back cover as against 3 covers advertised by One plus nord*Battery is as normal like other phone., which was expected to survive atleast 1.5 to 2 days minimum* Bulky and not slim* display is good*please see the comparison with Samsung M30, before you go for this.to conclude: dont  buy One plus Nord for 27,999. it is worth of 12000-14000 only."

310,Naved,Not a great phone at this price.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I never write my review about the products i purchase but this time I'm compelled to write over here.As I'm not camera freak so to me the poor camera quality to me isn't big issue. But While surfing on internet the phone sometimes hangs.Also the bettary drains out soon.And it shows no internet every time i write at Google search bar and i have to off the internet connection first then on it again. Now it may be my operators issue which is Airtel but it wasn't there when i was using Mi A1.Apart from this there are little things which really takea me off like, only white flash light and no yellow LED mix. Too mich brightness even at the lowest."
311,Harsha,A worthy purchase with zero Regrets,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is the first time I am buying a mobile of this price range.. I never exceeded above 20k.When I heard that OnePlus is releasing a budget phone I was excited and hoping it should be around 25k... It was 5k more than I expected but I was okay cause of the value and features it brings to the price...I have been using this mobile from 2weeks now. I must say whenever I hold it in my hand.. I go to another world.. I dont want to exaggerate but the attention to details even the very small ones make this phone a one to easily own and recommend to another...Final word: A blockbuster phone.
312,Ramesh L N,Software issue imy phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,  After 1moth I am writing this  review. I  Never wrote this type of negative reviews. Please do not believe all YouTubers reviews. Sorry to say this points. I only faced or others also faced  these type problems I don't know.1.One day suddenly all data erresed and got updated.

314,Sanjay Kumar,***,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera picture 📸 quality in night is far below expectations.Battery life looks to be good as of now with reasonably good quick charge.End up in Paying Rs. 6-7k extra on the name of OnePlus .
315,Arun Babu,HAPPY With Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My requirements while buying this phone were the following:1. It should be good to watch movies or series2. Good camera3. Play games without any lag.I am happy to tell that it has met all my requirements:1. As it has already been mentioned by most youtubers, the amoled screen has made it pretty good to watch videos in this phone.2. Camera is good enough. I am not a professional photographer so all I wanted was to take better clarity photos. Nord's camera has done decent job in that area.3. And about the third point, it's better than my expectations."
316,Saravanan,I'm a satisfied customer! Best and recommended phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect device for daily driver including all your official and personal needs. This is first phone in OnePlus, though the other variants of OnePlus quite higher range, this Nord is affordable price range with all premium features. The Oxygen OS is good and intuitive surfing experience, though it has the feeling of AOSP custom ROM and UI with other phones, but it is much better. And another very important impressive thing is Oneplus Nord developer team who is analysing the user feedback and releasing the monthly patches which is enhancing the user experience and much stable feature enhancements. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend to my F&F too. The camera picture quality needs more improvement as I personally feel that the pictures are average quality especially in indoor photography. Rest all good..."
317,montu lalwani,CALL RECORDING PROBLEMS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Why there's no auto call recording feature? Every time we have to manually press to record our calls even the baddest part is the voice ""Your call is being recorded"" this voice note also received by call receiver. They get alert that we are recording there call. Is there any way to remove that voice note and to record call automatically. ? Its worst thing ever."
318,SANDEEP SINGHAL,don't recommend. Bad camera quality. Not worth buying for 28000,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This is my first OnePlus phone. I was expecting a lot at this price. Everything is good about this phone but the camera is not good. Not at all good. I was using motrola and oppo f7 previously their camera quality is far better than nord. I made a big mistake exchanging my oppo f7. In nord pictures arevlike just as clicked by an ordinary camera. Pixels scattered. So if you are looking for a good camera phone don't go for it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they don't have any return policy for electronic items. So I am a totally disappointed with my decision of buying NORD. It should be priced not more than 18000-2000
319,Rothin Sarkar,OK OK PHONE,5.0 out of 5 stars,  2 days of use problum which i face is battery backup is very low. It drains too fast. In one min Of use it reduce to 3 to 4% from 100% of battery charge and comes to 96% and phone little heat up when 15 min of continue using. Other wise phone is good. It is charge quickly.

321,Amazon Customer,15 days with OnePlus Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi EveryoneWriting this review after using OnePlus Nord for 15 days. I was previously using oneplus 2 and after lots of wait finally bought one plus Nord.Display is awesome ,the colours are very good and realistic.Camera battery performance everything is good .Played pubg for 3 to 4 hours no lag in performanceSingle spaeker is compact and audible  but no Dolby Atmos.Selfie camera is failing to take clear shots at night time in artificial lights. While in daylight images are clear.Apart from that Best phone from OnePlus in this price segment."
322,Rajdeep Basu,Worth it : but needs optimisation,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a good pick overall.Overall score : 8/10Display :9/10In hand feel :8/10Speed and quickness :8/10Software optimisation :7/10Camera :6.5/10Build :7/10 It indeed was a little hyped regarding the 4 rear cameras. I'm assuming everyone who buys this already knows about the plastic build, which isn't really an issue. The only suggestion I have for other buyers : if photos and videos are important to you.. Then buy the pixel. But apart from that I think this phone is the best phone for its price. Could shell out 5k more and get one plus 7t cos the whole 5g thing is BS."
323,Prashant,OnePlus Nord...New Flagship killer......,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally, one plus Nord is in my hands...It's super smooth, fast, camera is just awsome, sound of speaker is just perfect, no display issues, trust me...Overall it's a complete package for those who are looking a great mobile under 30k.Amazon delivered a day earlier..."
324,Vyshnav cp,Blaster Nord.. MUST BUY..,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Superb phone... Getting on to it..Display is awesome 90hz🤩🤩Camera is also perfectMy score 8/10
325,Veer,It's hard to breathe.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disappointed with Google dialer and Google message apps, not auto call recording, even truecaller call recording is not working. Number search in dialer is not optimise. Parallel apps support is limited to a few apps.Needs a lot to improve.Group selfie images are not correct, skews the background"
326,Mehtab Singh,Read it before you buy!!✌️✌️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the amazing device i have ever used. Previously iam using samsung devices which lags after short time of purchase (due to exynos). But this has the best experience and the 90hz refresh rate on amoled screen is just awesome😍. After using it for a month my opinions are :-Pros:-1. It is manufactured in india.2. Best display i have seen , neither great as oneplus 8 nor bad. You will get best screen experience. (4.8/5)3. Camera are just execellent, nightscape mode is superb and pics of front cam also great. In ultrawide mode go for in well lit scenes in low light it sucks. (4.5/5)4. Charging is superfast if u are not using it while docked.5. This blue colour is awesome and have best shade like u will never get it on any other device , its unique in design.6. NEVER face any lag in both day to day work and in games. As i am heavy user and moderate gamer.7. Indisplay fingerprint sensor is fast and never face any unsuccessful attempt as well as in face lock sometimes it take time just 1 or 2 sec due to baclight conditions.8. Speaker is best and its loud and clear but gets hot if u play music on full volume for 20 min. Earpiece is great as its very loud and clear.9. Most important thing in the phone is its UI and it has most clean UI (Oxygen OS).Cons:-1. It has snapdragon 765g but in my opinion oneplus should give us 8 series of it. But u will not face any lag.2. Provided screen guard is flexible sheet which i can't say a guard at all it will just protect your device from scratches but didn't in drop. It has gorilla glass which protects your device but always go for more safety.3. Battery drains fast at 90hz which can be fixed in OTA updates.Conclusion:-If you want a device that never lacks you behind in terms of usage and day to day work then it is just made for you. And if you are a heavy gamer then go for 7t. There are many devices available in market like realme x3 but believe me! You will never get a clean ui experience like this one really loving it.NOTE:-I suggest you to put camera guard also it will not affect your images. And don't forget to put up on a bumper guard. Provided guard is good but i think it will won't survive if it falls from back side. Remember safety is first."
327,omkar matkar,Best phone under 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nordThe best phone under 30k.Using as my daily driver.The processor is nice Snapdragon 765g 5g processor.The vibration haptics was appropriate and on point.The cameras were great in my point at start it was lacking of white balance and exposure but after the updates there is improvement in colours and all.Front camera is also great and sharp.But there is a slightly problem in battery life because 1 day I was using my phone in 60hz display it was draining the battery faster as compared to 90hz because in 90hz mode the battery was not draining fast but in 60hz mode it was.Comes to display,the display was great. With that dual punch hole cutout looks great and there is less bezels in all side.The in hand feel of the phone was great. With glass back and front and 8.1 mm thickness and 184 grams weight the phone feels light weight and sturdy.And 🍒 on the top oxygen os this is my fav part because the os is like stock and great experience.Overall the best package in 30k mark...Conclusion.For the normal use, for nice camera and for normal  playing games then goo for it.But if your are a heavy games player than don't go for this because this phone is for professional users and for normal use with stock like experience of oxygen os then go for this phone."
328,venkadesh,My user experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved this phone. I was slightly thinking about tint issues but phone was not great amazing display. best ever display in this segment. Very well optimized performance only this camera performance is little low and low light shots are not perfect. 4 cameras in back is just marketing term 2 cameras are usefull. I think oneplus will improve camera performance in future updates. Overall when you buy you really does not disappoint, you will really enjoy it"
329,Mayank Punjabi,Oneplus Nord With so Many bugs and issue,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Seriously Worst experince I know device is better and good but oneplus Should improve there bugs before lauched because Its come with so many day to day issues #Display Bleading issue on low brightness on Grey screen Camera bluring issue pubg reconnecting issue battery draining so much faster issue  ... !! I know One plus Solveing by time to time But my Qus is that with them why they launched so early when there are So many bugs first they Solve it then should launch then it be much better ..!! I feel like Waste my 30k should Spent Low and satisfied by samsung or instied wait fr pixel4A or Should go For Iphone Se2
330,Darshan P.,Only behind in camera perfomance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   One plus NORD is a very nice smartphone with 2nd best hardware and really good software experience.Display tinting issues do exist but won't be visible in every app but only in apps with grey background and won't affect your day to day usageBattery life is good not the best but will easily last you a day even on 90 hertz at moderate usage and even if you lose battery percentage the warp charger 30 does its job and give you 50% of charge in 30 minutesAnd 100%in 1hour.Speakers are not bad has good loudness, good with the lows but struggles to produce crisp higher frequencies.And the only thing that stopped me to give it a 5 star review was the camera who's is very bad not in terms of resolution but in terms of processing, ultra smoothing of skin, noise, photos looks like if it was processed with extreme beautification mode even if not enables but don't lose hope the sensors used are very high quality and because of this this software base processing can be improved with future software updatedFinger print sensor and facial recognition are also good"
331,Vikram Nayak,Almost there,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  90Hz, decent processor and extremely fast. Everything works very well for this price. Only downside is the screen size. 6.44in sounds big, but in real it looks smaller compared to most other phones out there.Everything else is perfect on this phone. Coming from a Samsung, this just crushes it when it comes to responsiveness and performance. Camera is above average with decent lighting conditions and a side load of GCam"
332,Ashutosh Das,Well within expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone is smooth because of 90hz refresh rateBattery is well within expectations as as far as camera quality goes rear is well placed as per value of phone but front still needs improvement in indoor lighting conditions.Overall good phoneI upgraded from One Plus 3T
333,Suraj Lath,Worst Phone Ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst Phone Ever: OnePlus Nord has extreme network issues. Every now and then when people try reaching you - they hear the message ""The number you are calling is currently switched off, please try later"". I've reached out to Oneplus team to resolve the issue but they only asking me to restart device / reset Network settings which only resolves the issue temporarily. They phone helpline number keeps ringing and no agent picks up the phone and email reply is 48 hours late with template responses like ""Please restart phone, etc""."
334,Saurabh,Currently best premium midrange 5G device !,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Design : 8/10. Missing headphone jack.Mid frame is plastic.Camera Quality : 8/10. Low light photography is not that good. Needs optimization. OnePlus 7T is much better than Nord's camera.Display : 10/10 I didn't noticed any green tint issue in my display and display quality is worth the price.Speaker : 8/10. Speakers are loud but mono speaker. You may not enjoy the speaker quality.Battery life is good 7/10 : I expect atleast 5000 mAh battery if I'm paying 28k.Processor : 10/10 blazing fast processor, no lags observed.In-display fingerprint sensor works like a charm.Overall 7.5/10.No doubt that some cost-cutting is done which is not appropriate for a brand like OnePlus, quality should be preferred while designing such phones.Its a premium midrange device so I expect metal mid frame and a good camera quality with good battery life.OnePlus is able to meet some of my expectations but lacks many important things such as 3.5mm jack, stereo speakers, metal frame.Overall a good buy if u want a 5G device under 30k.Hit helpful! Thanks."
335,Amazon Customer,Cheap quality from one plus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  No words to say about the cheap quality.. I was using one plus mobiles for Almost 5 years( one plus 2,one plus 3 and oneplus 5t)  and this is the worst segment which I have seen. Camera quality is worst.. Finger print and battery life too is worst..Slow motion capture is horrible.. Too much blur and shake noticed.. I Definitely don't suggest to buy this.. Never expected such low quality mobile phones from oneplus even after paying 30k for 12 gb 256gb..cheap quality mobile"
336,Arjun,Decent budget phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First things first- it feels like a premium phone in a budget. You get what you paid for.Listing pros and cons here:Pros:1.The processor coupled with ample ram and storage is fast enough to carry your day to day tasks, no lags or hang issues2.the OS is smooth and clean(NO ADS). Dark mode is a great addition.3. Display is great, punchy and vibrant. It gives an edge over its competitors3. Sound is loud enough4. Very good call quality5. The first primary camera and second ultra wide camera wont disappoint you.Cons:1. Facing bluetooth connectivity and drop issues with wireless headphones. Two rounds of updates stating bluetooth fixes didnt fix it.2. Punch hole could have been a single one."
337,Bipul Kumar Shaw,Feels like much more expensive phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is fine for me as I am not a camera enthusiast.Vibrations feel good.Phone is snappy and quick like a flagship.No tint issues.Phone looks and feels very premium.Display out of the box is a faint yellowish, but you can change the color temp from setting to get whitest whites.The pre-applied screen protector is not that good and my unit also has a small particle/dust below the protector so I peeled it off.Weight and size of the phone is awesome.Just a bit disappointed as I had very high expectations from the front camera.Phone will get hot after first boot but then gradually it will get normal and much cooler than normal temp or redmi phones.PUBG gives consistent 60 fps will gfx tool."
338,Sachin Narayanan,Worth the money. Best phone in mid range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent compatibility with the processor, high Effie in touch on both 60hz and 90hz. Battery consumption varies on the take being performed. I believe RAM utilization also plays a big role in bettery consumption. However, the phone has instant charging option wherin you will be able to plug in for 10 min and work for 5-6 hrs for very less usable inputs(again depends on usage). One in all, w great release. Hardware is intact! Camera is excellent. Look, feel and weight are to be appreciated."
339,Amazon Customer,Above all the OnePlus nord!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  OnePlus Nord is a heck of a phone. Got it delivered on 3rd of August. Just glides through everything effortlessly. Just press on the throttle and it launches into orbit. Cameras are just awesome. After full day of usage and listening to songs and watching videos for around 2-2.5 hours it has enough juice to last through midnight and sometimes next day. It also gives that expensive phone vibe. in hand feel is just awesome and this size is very handy and feels light. Not going to regret this purchase. And for haters no screen tinting issues at low or high levels of brightness. Thumbs up OnePlus.
340,Varun Nigam,Full featured Premium Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone gives a premium look when you take this phone box in hand. After its unboxing the first thing which looks very attractive is Red Card Membership, its cover. Now let's talk about phone. Very handy to use. After set up gives you complete premium feel. Processor is very fast. And if I talk about it's in screen fingerprint sensor it's very fast and face recognition even more faster than fingerprint. Phone is quite heavy as it weighs 180 gm. Alert button above the lock button is a very good feature. Body seems like delicate and blue colour looks stunning. Camera works very good in dim light. I will give it as 5/5 for everything."
341,Abhay Singh Rana,Worth for money compared to this segment phones,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm new user to one plus family but believe it's just aswm to be the part of there family.The very first impression is look the blue marbel wow amazing feels premium in hand n then comes the software which is too smooth compared to this range phone.The most favourite part of this phone is battery charging capacity it's gets fully charged in 30 min.
342,Bijo George Philip,Great Device with corners cut!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a well balanced smartphone - Jack of all trades, master of none.What I feel is due North, OnePlus departed from Flagship but settled down before reaching the true 'budget' segment.If you ask for any alternatives to recommend - Not much, but how about considering an year old flagship instead?Here is a generation picture attached with OnePlus X."
343,Mihir Apurv Ramteke,Awesome Daily Driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The best thing about this phone is that it runs on Oxygen OS, undisputedly smoothest and best UI available with ""zero"" bloatware.....Camera feels good, especially front ultra wide...Charging is really really fast, as we expect from warp charge....Battery life could be an issue if you are traveling but for me  fast charging compensates that....At this price point with 5g compatibility, its the best Phone available in the market....Stop wandering in comments, just place order :)"
344,Agathian D,The best I've used till now,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I always go for the medium budget phones... With the announcement of NORD with upper middle budget phones, I wanted to book one as soon as it's released..Its going good as of now... And the existing issues with minor software issues and camera quality are being fixed by regular updates from OnePlus...So hopefully the mobile will exceed my expectations I have of it now..."

346,Amazon Customer,Go for higher end or any other brand,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera is more disappointing.they said shakey free pics but it still blurs the pics.finger print sensor is very bad. Small range phones bettter than this.doesnt look like one plus . Snapdragon 765 processor not upto the mark. Slight lag while accessing photos or anything.If anyone wants to take should go for higher end than nord or go for other brands. No option to return this phone else happy to return. Speaker quality is worst.sound might be loud but not crisp.
347,avinash jangde,Pro Purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Purchased on amazon prime day my experience with Nord is very smooth till now .🔘Display loved it great as it has OLED🔘Fingerprint just amazing (in display )🔘Camera should be better but it is good.🔘Battery life very good give you 6-7 hr SOT🔘Performance  fantastic as it has SD 765G🔘Speaker - single speaker sufficient loud
348,Vinay Kadu,Loved It!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good deal in this price range! Loved the phone. Decent camera quality.. premium design.. turbo charging.. excellent battery backup. Just found fingerprint scanner little slower compared to others but it doesn't matter at all. And yeah.. loved to read that.. ASSEMBLED IN INDIA🇮🇳
349,Palak Shah,Good Phone for the price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally One Plue back in the space of 20k range.. Nord along with its feature rich packing is a real good part.. Finger print is fast but not very accurate  1 in 10 times you need to repeat it..Battery is working fine for normal use, but if you are heavy on Games u require a charge more in a day.. but that's not a problem given fast charging of One plus..Camera is decent for this price range,Performance is very good thanks to Oxygen Os and Snapdragon combined with decent RAMALL in all a very good phone for the budget buyers in 20k range"
350,Giyas Baleeghuddin Ahmed,Hype Hype Hype.....! Don't expect lot,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Thanks to Amazon for Fast Delivery as promised for Prime Members2nd thanks to Hfdc Bank for Debit Card No Cost EMI. It cost me for 27k for 12gb/156gbAbout OP NORD : 5G network still not available, Camera average nothing new surprising, About Display like these u can get in any 20k below mobile Amoled with UFP. Apps like XShare XClub are from Infinix mobile. AR not compatible and no options for GCAM App install. Battery backup not impressive but thanks u get 30w fast charging. Go for OP 8 it's a best choice. I given 5 star only for Oxygen OS stock Android like experience."
351,Keerthana,"Happy Customer 😁😄,Just go for it 🤗",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, I need a phn for 3years and above and then I got to know about nord very well after watching many reviews on it, and then I dared to order it against its negativity just by trusting oneplus , and then finally I got my nord on 26th of august, Im really impressed with my nord. It is super fast and the display is amazing. As I went through all the reviews before buying, I checked all the cons immediately after receiving. I would to mention few things that i obswrved on my nord are:Coming to display, I dont have any tint issues & the display is soo smooth and very fast to access.Coming to camera performance , its is absolutely good and satisfied (except slowmotion motion at indoor has screen flickering issue and macro lens is completely blur,other than these the camera is absolutely fine at both indoor and outdoor).Coming to Battery , it is good bt not outstanding(On continuous usage , U can use it for 10 hrs), and charging is super fast.Coming to processor ,it is super fast and yes ofcourse it can handle pubg and other games without any lags.And I dont have any network ,sim or bluetooth issues .And last but the best , OXYGEN OS is just wooww.I also received 2 software updates till date and will definetly inform what i noticed from it after proper  usage.Finally I loved this nord and im absolutely satisfied with my product .I definitely recommend nord at this price range rather than other mobiles."
352,Saket Rajput,DO READ THIS BEFORE BUYING 1+Nord:,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Anyone Buying this Smartphone and is here to see the Review, i want to say that ""Close your Eyes and just Click the Order Now Button""This Phone is so Awesome from every perspective!Before buying i was also so confused, i watched tons of youtube videos,And many of them were saying that Camera is Average, Build quality is not nice, feels cheap etc etc.Just Ignore them, i have bought and using these phone for atleast 2 weeks..And must say 3 things are the best in this phone:1) Display2) Processor & Battrey3) Camera (except the Macro one)"
353,Emil,Very good phone for price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overal very good phone.Battery doesn't last very long not even a day.But that was not a concern, charging only takes 45min. So it's alright.Camera is really good. It adds a bit of warmth to all the photos, compared to samsung, amdni personally like the warmth, which adds to the reality feel.And fingerprint scanner is one of the best out there."
354,BENSON MATHAI,Good one,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is really a good one compared to any other one in this range.Battery life is somewhat ok sometimes it is getting more than 1 day if ur using just call and some net surfing.If u r gamer then the battery is not up to the mark only getting 8-10 hours with max 2 hours of game play.Camera The main sensor 48MP is good but it can't be used for zooming purpose if u want to zoom and take its only supported with 12 MP sensor overall the 48 and 12 sensor is doing a decent job .Talking about the other two sensors 5MP DEPTH sensor is good that's all not an excellent one.But the worst part is the 2MP macro I don't know why they included this sensor may be for the quad camera namesake, the most useless one this phone.And overall talking about the phone the processor 765 is futerproof and giving a good performance, simply it is Jack of all but master in nothing. I faced some hang issue with Twitter twice, leaving that no complaints until now.And the best and most interesting part is the oxygen OS, it is working like smooth butter.Overall the oneplus is good in all, but not a master in any section.For a regular user the Nord is ok"
355,Himanshu Kumar,💯 Plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Lovely🤗, sleek💥, stylish and Shimmery🥰✨ pastel design. Not even trying to use it as it would get dirty😅, viz. it's so like a Touch me not plant🍀😅, so clean. It's my first OnePlus devise, so instead of becoming skeptical due to so much critics by many a youtubers, I'd still like to cling with it due to its Oxygen OS, and clutter plus bloat-free experience. Rest no phone is perfect, even the Premium ones have their flaws, will still go with this devise and experience the magical journey with it.✌️🙂"
356,Prajwal,One plus Nord day 1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just got it yesterday,after pre ordering it on 27th July. So far so good. Ui is smooth. The feel of the phone is good. Easy to handle. The camera is exceptional as promised. Wide angle option on front camera is cool."

358,Amazon Customer,Just read it then buy it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader and the face unlock is really good, battery life is descent, when you start with a 100% you could play 3 to 4 hours of gaming and stil have a 60% balanceNow about the camera quality it's really nice if you compare it with others midrange phones but if you campare it with other OnePlus device then you will be disappointed still the main and ultrawide is really nice but the macro it not that good overall the camera system is niceThe performance is really nyc it's fast smooth and like OnePlus says the oxygen it breathes is really clean, gaming performance is too goodThe screen quality is best , that super amoled display with 90hz feels fast and feels premium.The build is really good Unless you try to break it like jerryrigeverything and this blue marble colour is soo good that even sky feels shame..."
359,SYEDISMAIL,Good ok,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All are good but I find battery issue in nordI have already used 1+ 5T,6T, no issues in that one day battery 20% balance of 3000mahIn nord 4115mah I feel it comes more than a day but it stands only for upto evening onlyFull day battery 0%😌"
360,Mohammed F.,Small Display issue... otherwise fantastic,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Small display issue is seen when we put Nuanced Dark theme on phone...that is quite disappointing.. Otherwise Nord Is Fabulous 🥰
361,sonu raj,Really u could ask 4 everything......🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.fingerprint reads very fast as per our expectations2.battery life is not too much but it's good approx one day by net surfing or watching movies ..... Bt i think battery life doesn't matter because of its fast charging .... Nord charges vry fast  approx 50 min take to full charge and 10 min charge is for 30 Percent ,,,overall it's nice3.camera quality like a flagship level ..... especially main camera is excellent work and nightscape is awesomeOverall it's a perfect package phoneU could ask for everything"
362,Shubham barsainya,Decent yet not up to the mark with high standards of OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am die-hard fan of OnePlus owning 7 and now nord. always appreciated their sincere effort towards making their customer happy with quality products,but this time around the Quality has been compromised by OnePlus.the screen said to be 90Hz amoled doesn't feel like one. Ufs 3.1 should have been included.Camera is worse than ever. Macro camera is of no use, depth sensor too. Although weight is pretty much balanced. feels good while holding. OS is as cool as ever. Charger is quick. Decent phone, cost shuld have been atleast 3k less. Below OnePlus standards."
363,Samit,The story goes like this....,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have spent my three months of salary too but this phone and I am not satisfied now because I m broke but still I look at my phone and be happy the whole day even though i am hungry.Just kidding.....🙈🙈The phone is a wow for the price. Display and performance is the best in the price segment with 765G processor. Finger print scanner works like a charm. Internet connectivity is superb with 4g. The only downside is the camera which is just good enough to get through the day.
364,Manosh,Amazing phones with all necessary accessories,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered 3, not one. It's definitely worth the money. Super charging speed and display. I have been using Google phones all along. And this one is surely done a good job filling the shoes. Playing PUBG is smooth. The accessories are really good. OnePlus has made sure you do not need to visit ant store to buy screen guard and back cover."
365,Aaqib,Awesome flagship phone at a reasonable price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my First OnePlus mobile and I am writing this review after 3 days of use.Firstofall thanks to #amazon for fast delivery.The below review is for 12gb/256gb model1) Fingerprint and face unlocks works very quick2) camera quality is good but much when u zoom it to full capacity like it miss fineness3) battery life is good. I had charged to 100% and watched complete movie of 2 hrs online with hig quality resolution and 82% of charge was still remaining. But if you use for games then batter doesn't last long.4) charging is awesome it charged from 15% to 100% in just 52mins5) screen touch, 90hz refresh rate works superb6) no lagging was observed till now though I had played games like F1 race, will try Assault and post an update only if there was lagging.7) I like the zen mode a lot. As I get disturbed with phone often.8) Display resolution is excellent, I don't have much experience with other mobile screens but I really liked it's colours"
366,Rajesh Kumar Sahu,Not matching with their advertisement.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Before buying please read the return policy carefully. Both sides camera quality is very poor.Not matching with their nord advertisement.Amazon approach with their policy would have  done much better.
367,sahil pataskar,OnePlus nord....must try,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is great at its processing and never lagged while multitasking, 765g worth it. Camera quality is just awesome at this price range. I know there was some issue related to macro camera but thanks to OnePlus they never let their users to loose the faith in them...they fixed the macro camera issue with the update as usual. Battery life is at its best. Pre installed screen protector never lets you down, even gorilla glass 5 is hard enough to bear the accidental drops. Fingerprint sensor detects smoothly and speedily although no one can hate OnePlus fingerprint sensors😀. Headphone jack is missing but it's totally fine. Although i did deep excavation of this phone and found that there are some major issues related to camera quality like it blurs when captured picture is zoomed and also some problems with selfie camera such as 4k 60fps video recording takes efforts to open and power consumption of phone also have some general issues but hope so OnePlus will fix it with software updates."
368,Ayush,I am in love with Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks...I am in love with this phone completely.. I can say you wont find this kind of user experience in any other phone under 30K...765G + Oxygen OS is truly awesome...it's so smooth that you hardly face any issue..I can give 5/5 star to its display (Fluid Amoled + 90 hz) ✓Camera experience is better than what I had expected...I think back to back updates to fix the camera accuracy/issues worked...Battery performance is decent too.. what OnePlus had claimed during launch of this product its the same. It takes exactly one hour to fully charge this phone and with moderate usage it will last over a day...Cons:The only drawback in this phone is the speaker...it's not too loud. But with earphone/HP you will have an awesome experience..

370,Rishabh Kumar Sharma,Good midrange smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after 1 month.Cons:-1) Camera is not upto the mark, but Oneplus team is trying to resolve it by continuous Software Update.2) No stereo speaker.3) No 3.5mm headphone jack.Pros:-1) Very good display.2) Good Battery life, 9+hrs of Screen on time.3) Speaker has good sound even it has mono speaker.4) Camera is getting better.5) Fast Charging.6) Super of daily use, smooth performance.Others issues review:-1) No tint issue faced from starting.2) No bluetooth issue.3) JerryRig shows phone can be breakable with bare hand, but you are not JerryRig it is good phone not easily breakable instead of having plastic frame."
371,Nitin,Awesome Phone. Go for it !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone. When I received the package, it was well packed. So, no issues in that. Coming to the phone, it is an awesome one. I went through a lot of reviews about this phone and most of which were negative and not encouraging. Though they scared me to purchase it, but I still wanted to buy it and I feel that I made the right decision. I did not find any issues with the phone. Everything about the phone is just good. 😀"
372,Sairam Rallabandi,Is it one plus phone or a realme phone?? Stay away from Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a big fan of oneplus and using one plus 6t from past 2 years. Was really excited and bought oneplus nord mobile for my wife. My excitement finished then and there. Phone doesn't look premium at all, looks very cheap and plastic. Biggest let down is the camera, it shoots like a 10 years back phone and selfies really suck.If you're thinking to buy please Invest 5000 more and take one plus 7t.It is a better buy that this.You have disappointed many oneplus with this product!"
373,Akash Patki,Power that it can't handle and the theory of Return,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am One Plus user since 2016, and Bought this Phone after a Lot of reviews and a months wait.No reviewer, absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility.If you ask me features.. i cant say they are any less than expected. I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn't heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to ""Item received is defective/does not work properly."".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution."
374,Mohammed azhar,OnePlus Nord...worth a Buy...The New premium show,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received mobile even before sale started on AmazonSo one of the first customer to useThe phone touch is like butter and design is really goodI switched from OnePlus 5T to Nord ,so no issue in understanding the features.Oxygen is the beast UI in Mobile phonesPro's1.90Hz display-This you will understand the difference when to switch between apps, gaming and reading articles2. Fluid AMOLED display better than many phones in this range....compared with few Mobiles that my friends have.. OnePlus Nord is way better3. Battery life is just awesome.. even at 90Hz4. Design is very pleasing and elegant5. Camera- Rare Camera & Front both are good ...I don't use much still I think OnePlus must give update through which it can improve alot .6. Oxygen OS- Best in market & and best in class7. Warp charge is insanely fast wow....fast (30W)Con's (Mostly are expectations as a old OnePlus user)1. Side body being metal than bring plastic2. More colours, I like one which I have but would have being more delighted if could have got moon light black..Important Note:1.Many features such apps having dark themes,quick zoom to screen size, customize app icons, colour customizing and many more gives OnePlus mobile like Nord way more advantage than other mobiles in market even if they give bigger screen,better camera or battery2. Most important thing it will give to all Android updates for next 3 years....100% sure because I got started OnePlus 5T with Oreo (8.0) then I even got Android 10... So no other Android mobile company at present give this.#Oneplusnord#stayhome#staysafe"
375,dev,OnePlus Nord,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is good not that awesome it take around 1hr 15min for full charge , performance wise it is smooth and fast to use but I am really sad with nord camera I found 3 problems in camera first portrait single person mode click black and white image second worst slo mo I have seen third micro lens is bad . I seen one or two problems more ...  When you watch hd or 4k content there is problem of auto brightness and issue of display ( green and pink tint ) when brightness is low. Anyway it is not a deal breaker but overall I will give 6.5/10"
376,Rahul singh,Above average Phone; Poor battery backup,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life: Drains very fast, heavy users will get only 6-7 hrs of battery backup also charges battery 100% in 1 hr.Display very goodSound above averagePerformance excellentIf you need good battery backup please go for another phone..  Nord battery Drains very fast really fast.."
377,ishan s.,One plus nord is here,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product by 1+, this is my third phone of 1+ after 1+x and 1+5, Blue marble color is catchy. Battery life is good,, oxygen is best as always. Camera quality is very good,got an update for macro camera setting, nightscape camera is excellent, did not face any issue of tinting in low brightness. Processor is fast and full charging under 1 hr.All in all very good phone in the range"
378,Amazon Customer,Review with 8 days usage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  HiAfter usage of more than 8 days, I'm writing this review.Pros1. Looks n feel is definitely premium2. Fresh feel of product3. Battery life is good with mild usage, will easily last a day.4. Fast processor5. Amazing capability of multi tasking6. Oneplus os is gr8Cons1. Camera is okay, but could have been better, depth in pics lack original colors  though day light photography is okay2. Back finish is gloss, tend to slip out of hands so back cover is must"
379,Tushar mishra,what was the hype for? this for 30k?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  one plus nord lacks camera stability, takes few secs while capturing a photo if moved the photo becomes hazy, have to keep  the phone and object steady till the photo loads. havent seen such in budget phone as well. hopefully one plus can fix this with an update in future. one more problem is as the picture clicked from back camera has lot of saturation like realme hones it looks artificial.  front camera is worthless. i mean in atificial light where there is too much light above head example in big showrooms malls or big shops or supermarket where there is lots of light above you nord completely messes up the white balance i mean you can hardly see the background properly. even the colours come disortedi mean its not accurate. if you click a photo in such condition you will notice the face is filled with light and you can hardy use that photo. i dont know if this is happening in my phone or everyone's phone. only plus point in this phone is its haptic feedback and when you hold the phone it will fit you hand beautifully. no need to mention the oxygen os. fingerprint is average i think due to animation it looks slow. amoled displayis beautiful. charging speed is fabulous. i mean i recharged the battery in around 40 mins. backup is also average. overall its an average phone nothing extra ordinary in it. there are better phones at better price in market. hopefully one plus fixes the camera issue if so other problems can be managed"
380,sunil,Good one in 30K range ..,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Received it on 2 Aug 2020 ..Performance is very good ..Voice clarity is quiet good ..Device speaker is very good even at high volume with clear sound.CameraFront:  wide camera option is as good as described .Back camera : okBattery  : charging is quiet fast in half an hour my phone get charged from 10% to 80% ..With normal use .. such as WhatsApp and voice calling .. it can survive one day ..Overall a good handset in this range if you are looking for performance.
381,Pratik Pattanaik,Great buy if you are not into photography!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The build of the phone looks very premium, however, surprisingly it is very lightweight. It is way lighter as compared to my Redmi K20. Hence, the Redmi K20 feels a bit sturdy on my hand. That doesn't imply that the Nord is not well built but the on hand feeling is well a bit disappointing to me.The cameras are kind of okay. The main camera is the one that will give you impressive pictures. The macro is too weak. Personally I'd have preferred a telephoto. Again let me compare with the K20. The primary camera of Nord is way better. The OIS will help you click better shots with the camera. The nightscape is impressive (better than what Redmi offers). Now if you can find the right GCam for Nord, I guess photography will be sorted. The Ultrawide camera will give you mixed feelings. Even I can't decide if the K20 is better or the Nord.Battery wise it lasts a day for me with regular usage. That's pretty good. Charging speed is pretty exciting!The 90hz screen is a pleasant affair but I am yet to experience its impact other than while swiping and scrolling.The fingerprint reader is I guess the best in class. It's fast and accurate. I have come to love it. I always favored hardware fingerprint reader after my experience with the K20, but Nord has me loving it.One thing I love is the software. I am a fan now. I preferred stock android over any other skin. But, maybe it is Oxygen OS that deserves to be the best. This is quite stock-ish. I used an Android One phone and then switched to this, and I feel like at home. With some renovations here and there.The rest of the hardware will cover you for a complete experience. I guess a metal frame is what could have made it better. Jerry did Bend it like Beckham.So if you are looking for great cameras, don't buy this. Honestly, the Realme X series will fare you better or wait for the Pixel. If you are just a casual clicker then the primary camera won't disappoint and the Nord does tick all other boxes. I think the experience of Oxygen OS should make up for what it lacks. And it's a mid ranger so don't expect flagship quality. It is pretty well balanced."
382,SHIVAM SINGH,One plus nord is the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome camera and storage space
383,Sai sushanth,A seriously good experience :>,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I gotta say I was quite unsure on how my experience with a brand new OnePlus would turn out but damn this was the best choice I probably made. The feel, smoothness, customisation, performance is absolutely stunning, what made the experience even better was the fact that the device is seriously light weight better than all the other mobile experience I've had up until now. The GPU though Beast! I've tested it on the most heaviest game I've seen up till now though and I could not see a trace of stutter or any sort of lag. I used to find it in flagships lmao yeah Nord is that good!And yeah the camera experience is a little alright if you don't really care about it much but if you happen to be a camera freak then yeah this might be a hard choice. If you're a mid range gamer and sucker for fps and performance then yup this is the best device you can get your hands on! The battery life, yeah I haven't tested it much but I think it lasts about the same time it specifies in the battery optimization window, so there's really no issues there :>Make sure to get the best out of it by optimising to your specific requirements and enjoy ! I'm having a good time. Oh yeah and don't think twice before buying it just do it xD"
384,Amazon Customer,Camera is very poor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very very bad camera my 1+6 give better photo than nord, because of the camera specification i bought nord and one plus dissappointed me with nord.  I thought 48 MP camera give good quality of picture and i really dissappointed. Dont bye if you look for camera otherwise the phone is good"
385,Anuraag Mathias,"Seemless, smooth experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got it today. No display issues or heating issues as such. The battery will take 4-5 cycles to get to maximum capacity but I'm already getting good battery back up. The back of the phone gets slightly warm during the warp charging bit you won't notice it until you look for it.All in all, great phone. No issues during casual gaming as well. The processor is more than capable. Selfie camera and rear main camera are absolutely amazing. Just pretend the macro camera isn't there. 😋Will update with any issues if I face any."
386,Althaf 6.,Performance is awesome price worthy people are jealous at this launche of one plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using my old mobile for long time of 2gb ram and looking for a perfect mobile and one plus launched nord iam using it from 9 days the 12gb variant and the performance is superb camera quality is also good but I have disappointed at one thing when iam stream prime the volume icon struck at its place and it interrupt so much at that time touch was not working when I close the aap the problem still continues i have restart my phone then it was clear from that place same problem occurs when I am playing pubg Hope it will fix in update
387,Aadi,Overall Good except camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   Overall phone is goodFinger prinr is goodBettry life is good with 90Hz/ better with 69HzNo heating issuse found till nowOnly one problemCamera require some time to capture image and too much time in proocesingSome slow motion video , portrait selfie,night photos is given found good but it require too much times to proceess and save."
388,Dijo Daison,One love,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. You'll get 8GB ram, 128Gb internal storage (20GB is taken up for the OS) & 5G although you won't get a 5G connection everywhere yet. The performance of the device is fast and smooth af.Regarding the display, thers's OLED distortion issues at extreme viewing angles, ie, slight shift in color and temperatures at oblique angles of screen. But its not visible with non white background and  NOT the ""green tint"" issue  that everyone is talking about.  Though it looks normal when looking at the screen head on, blue glare stripes are visible as you tilt at extreme angles of screen affecting whites of the phone(basically any app that supports a white background)One point to note, it warns when you put in  two sim cards, you are unable to connect to a 5G network until they release the software update. Having 5G makes the device future proof. No lag on phone and ticks all the boxes decent cameras and it will only get better with updates from 1+. Included is a phone case and screen protector. It's definitely a flagship killer."
389,Bhavik Limani,Perfect Budget Quality Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  #1. The Color Gray Onyx perfect. OxygenOS which runs as smooth as they come.#2.  The quality of the sound as speaker in the bottom looks like an extra louder.#3. Plastic Design looks and feels similar to the metal that feels the premium phone.#4. Screen and refresh rate great as mentioned.#5. Battery last long full use in Game & Multi-tasking.#6. As a Gamer, it's good and perfect for mid gaming phone as we with the processor.The Perfect Budget Phone with the Camera, Processor, and Premium feel compare to other brands with the same features and price range."
390,SP,Jack of all trades!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolute value for money, considering the features that it provides. Definitely the the second best of everything, although I would rate the screen performance first class. After the first two updates, camera and power backup just got a lot better. There is ample RAM and processing power for your daily mobile chores including playing COD. Except for the oxygen wrappers and couple of oneplus apps, the OS is pretty much clean and neat.Still not sure why people bother to spend more than half a lakh of Indian monies for a similar phone with a logo of a bitten apple behind it :PDownsides -> I really miss the 3.5mm jack :( . They could also have included a telephoto camera instead of that second front facing camera (Just absolute waste)."
391,Mavana Vijay,THE BEST PHONE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life drains bit fast on continue usage . But Software is Amazing Osum Superb , design Beautiful . Totally Happy with Phone 🥰👌🏻👌🏻 Thankyou One Plus Nord ❤️And Packing and Delivery 👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻 . Thankyou Amazon"
392,Mahesh,A budget  all-rounder from OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a excellent phone , It's definitely a allrounder with gud price , everything is fine , battery life is gud..7hr to 8hr screen on time if you use normally like insta fb Twitter Play games for few hours . Camera main sensor is excellent and also wide angle sensor is decent, macro is okay. Front cam photo is gud and video is excellent. Screen is excellent amoled with 90hz and UI is excellent with already 4 updates came till now. OnePlus always known for fast updates and Oxygen UI.Performance is fine even PUBG and call of duty running smoothly. OnePlus will also give update for PUBG high ultra settings. No color tint issue with mine I have tried in dark condition check many times.No phone is giving this much of specs with price. Truly value for money comparing from European and US markets it's cheaper by 10k to 12k.Cons -Not a big battery but it's fine if you are not a heavy gamer ,plus fast charging is there it's handy.Macro cam - It's macro cam average ,it's not gud but they gave two updates for macro.Depth cam - It's also averageSlow Mo - No 480f/s"
393,jaishree verma,Not worthy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 8gb ram variant.  let's talk about pros ans cons -1. Battery life - battery drains too fast. However it has fast charging as well. But you need to charge your phone very often. For 100% battery it last up to 7 hours on screen. That's pretty low when you are into phone all time2. Front camera - picture quality is average. Not that great. Biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast 2-3 seconds. There's a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image. And that's really annoying. Another major drawback poor quality in low light.3. Back/Rear Camera. Picture quality is good, also in dim light.4. Gaming - pubg. It runs smooth with graphics5. Fingerprint. - i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all. Again it takes seconds to response. Arrgghh... annoying when you are in hurry.All over, better go for flagship phone. It is not worth spending money. I feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price."
394,Saptarshi Bhattacharjee,OnePlus Nord 12GB 256GB Blue Marble & Gray Onyx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yes, got both the versions!Giving a review after 3 days of use when I finally had to charge the phones again.- Used for HD online game: lag free experience and impressive battery back up even after considering these to be new phones.- Great overall built and looks, more than value for money.- Quite an impressive camera but the 4-camera set up was unnecessary other than keeping up with the market demands.- The inbox phone case is a simple one but not too great a protection for the camera bump.- A few apps come pre-installed and might be unnecessary.The last 2 points may be considered a time-waster but not my fault, could barely find a legit ground to complain. Haha!Please keep in mind this is not a flagship phone but to cater to mid tier needs, for which OnePlus Nord supersedes though!"
395,praamoth raahul,Buyers read this,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Speed is goodRear camera is goodWhen it comes to battery life it doesn't last for a 12hrsAnd worst part of the phone is front camera not upto the mark @oneplus
396,Akhil,Satisfactory + one of the best midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Just received it.....and the phone is fantastic cum satisfactory ..iam not saying that it's not good I must say its awesome in some of its unique aspects ....Only thing is it's macro lens -useless lens with bad quality ..but Main camera isQuite nice needs some updates..but overall amazing ..selfies are the main attraction...Oxygen OS is love and battery is quite good... In this price range it's not bad and gaming is also quite nice ...Full review after 1 months usage ..okay then enjoy your nord !
397,Gajendra D,Not extraordinary,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1) If you are looking for a premium phone , OnePlus Nord is not an option for you.2) Phone gives feeling of OPPO or VIVO phone for which you need not to pay 28k or 30K.3) Fast charging is good, Camera of fine (not extraordinary)4) Display is good.5) Heating problem still persist in oneplus devices."
398,santanu sarkar,Review after using 2 months,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  On screen fingerprint reader is really slow than back side fingerprint reader, some times finger print is not detected at all. Face unlock super fast, works really good even in complete darkness.. Battery not an issue for me as i don't play any games (lasts for a day).. Camera quite good.. Google Chrome has an issue..sometimes search results doesn't show up.. Have to back and search again otherwise phone is running smooth"
399,Sayok,Do NOT Buy. Green tint issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  There is a green tint on screen of the phone. There ie a bar on the camera notch.The bix came in crumbled from all sides. Heavily disappointed in this phone. Please Do Not Buy
400,jigna,Received a defective phone which wont start,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received a dud phone which refused to start. Which was quite shocking given Oneplus brand. One top of it, the phone is unavailable now, and wrt to refund, Amazon pickup person wants to start the phone before picking up (which will not start as the phone is defective), so overall pretty I m stuck with a phone which is a paperweight, waiting for Amazon to resolve it. Very disappointed with Oneplus though."
401,abhishek,NORD fails to meet standards,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display problem, one Plus fails to address the obvious hardware issue and is just trying to fool the customers i should have rather bought pixel 4a check the tint it doesn't stop in grey background trust me it is very much noticable as a red hue on white screens too in the night. I feel that iff i use it in the night my eyes will get spoilt because the red hue is very annoying. Disappointed by one plus, didn't expect cheap product like this.Can adjust on anything other than display."
402,Meghnath Saha,Well nord is here finally,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The review is after 7 days of use..Well from the last few years I have been dreaming of taking one plus finally nord is here after 3 attempt online..So much hype in this year.Finally got the 12+256Gb variant .Here is some review of every segment1.Ease of use -Well oxygen os is something which is so smooth , always wanted to have its experience finally it's here..The os is so smooth and crisp..with 90 hz refresh rate you can literally run so many apps in background.It is getting updates every week so get ready for android 11 by year end.2.performance - As I have told earlier is is smooth and hardly you feel any lag.One thing surprise me is the Google keep application if you set in desktop and try to use the writing feature the phone response to it very late..3.Battery life - I am hardcore user.I used it as BYOD at my work..all the office apps from Microsoft is there, So many calls in whole day, Battery depending on your usage, I have screen time of 5-6 hours daily, the best thing is Wrap charging its the best hardly took 45-50 mins to get charged ..In the beginning it will take sometime to collaborate with screen ,daily use after 3-4 days you will have the stable battery life so don't get upet if it's drain quickly in first or 2nd day..4.gaming - Well pubg is banned but I have played some other games.. Experience is good.it also has that fnactic mode which disrupts background activities and notification it's good thing to see.5. Camera-Well I would rate 3.5 out of 5.you are paying 28-30 k but will expect something good..the macro camera is uselss and hope it will improve as per updates..front facing camera is good...The wide angle camra is lacking detail..Nightscape is good and portrait is good ..I will udpate as per usage in upcoming week or month.."
403,Harshad Salunke,Almost everything in good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Onepluse Nord (12+256)ProsPerformance: 765G has its own sustainability rate. So in performance it gives you the powerful CPU in mid-range phones. Gaming is something the OnePlus Nord can handle fairly well, in terms of performance. Popular games like PUBG Mobile and COD: Mobile run at 100% stabilityCamera: it comes with the quad camera setup 48+8+5+2 and in front it has 32+8. Wide angle range is 119° for rear camera while wide angle range is 105° wide. It supports features such as HDR, It gives you a video of 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60fps, it offers amazing selfies, the quality of the produced photos is very good in both natural & low light conditions, the images, videos & text look very sharp & clear, It is attractive & fashionable.(Also check the cons)Wrap charging: OnePlus has given what they promised. Wrap charging of 30T support provides 0 to 100% within 40 mins. Seems like last long day.Built:There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back which makes your phone scratch proof. It has plastic frame considering low cost it's fine to have it.Speaker: There is only one speaker under OnePlus Nord. It is not ideal for videos or games, but it becomes reasonably loud and sounds good.Red club membership: It will provide you 50GB of cloud storage. Also with several benefits.Cons:Battery: 4115 mAh battery provides less backup while you are gaming. Drains quickly. But if you are not a gaming person it lasts for a day with normal use.Camera: It has quad camera setup but Micro lens of 2MP has no use. If you are a pro photographer you better know how to click micro photograph.Headphone jack: Maybe you can call it as business strategy OnePlus Nord doesn't have 3.5 mm headphone jack. So one has to buy Bluetooth earphones or ear buds. (Simultaneously launch oneplus buds and promoted)Expandable memory slot: unavailability of expandable memory slot might give you problem later after few years of use. Considering memory storage.5G: OnePlus Nord is a future ready phone with 5G setup but it allows 5G+4G sim only one 5G sim could be used at a time.In the end If you are a fan of OnePlus and love to have good performance phone with mid-range you better chose this. It's promising. 👍"
404,Sai Krishna Anantaraju,Good phone in budget but not perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved the display. It's big and super clear and viewing angles are phenomenol. Coming from Pixel 2, I wanted a phone that has stock android or near stock android UI as I hate bloatware or ads and I need regular updates. Thankfully, there are none. Fingerprint reader is superfast. I agree with many ppl on the pros they mentioned. A few things that I didn't like about this phone are:1. Android auto not working. After connecting phone to my car using cable, I see android auto screen on my cars gets flickering for sometime and then lost connection. You can check on this issue in oneplus community as well.2. Time will stay unchanged until you focus on the screen. Even clock app gets updated time after a fration of second. This happens when night mode on as well. When you take out your phone during the night, it will be very bright. Once you unlock, them only it will become dim.3. Edge round cutouts on screen will partially hide content on some applications.4. Google play update fails every time.5. Camera not upto the mark. Expected for a person coming from Pixel device.6. Hardware buttons are protruding on the sides and they are sensitive and can easily be clicked unintentionally. I took many screenshots without realising. I locked the screen many times as well. Buttons could've been little hard.7. As geekyranjit mentioned in one of his videos that auto brightness sensor calibration could be better. There are a lot times I manually had to increase the brightness.Overall, it's great value for money phone. It feels premium in your hand."

406,anjali.budakoti,Worst battery and camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst phone ever....please dont go for this phone this is really the worst phone ...battery drains bery fast not even last for 4-5 hours. And if you play 3-4 games of pubg it will come to 10 from 100 in just 3-4 games ....and camera is the worst..specially the front camera in low light it showing pictures you are clicking from a keypad phone.... And noramlly if you click there is soo much of noise...please avoid buying this phone
407,akhilesh y.,Network issue / Internet issue,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is huge unkown strage network issue on oneplus nord. While internet works on browser but have network issue on few apps. I could not play free fire and pubg due to network issue. But when i connected to wifi i was able to play these game.  I tried changing sims, resetting wiffi and internet setting,i even factory reset the phone but nothing works. Either oneplus should explain this strange network issue and come with a solution or everyone should get a refund or replacement."
408,Jai vikrant,Bluetooth connectivity issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone has a serious Bluetooth connectivity issue. Bluetooth device automatically disconnects and doesn't connects again. Since it is not equipped with a 3.5 mm jack it makes the situation worse.Oneplus community forum is stacked up with this complaint.Do it 100 times before buying it.

410,Mohammed sohel ahmed,Nord review,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is superb in quality and every aspects except camera in low light conditions I have been using this phone since one week playing pubg daily for about 5 hours there is no heating issue fingerprint reader is very accurate good battery life tested playing pubg below 15 percentage I could play 4 livik maps no tint issue observed while usage if you are heavy gamer my suggestion is no if your average user I woul higly recommend this phone I would rate 4 stars reduced one star for camera quality oxygen is superb in usage very smooth.
411,Jidnesh J.,Overall satisfied with OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Initially there were few issues with the phone, mainly Bluetooth connection stability. But a recent software update has resolved the issue. Battery life is decent for gamers, finger print scanner works as advertised, camera quality has been improved but slow motion feature no longer gives an option to choose resolution and frame rate like before."
412,Zovi,It's not upto the mark as promised,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is lil bit slow compared to my old phone vivo V7, which instantly detects n unlocks but this is not the same with one plus NordBattery life is also not upto the markNo doubt it charges quickly but it quickly  drains tooContinuous usage of 2-3hrs heats up the phone slightlyCamera quality is good specially ultra wide modeOnly 2 camera's of rear one's are working other 2 are just extra with no useSo basically they promise for 4 camera's n gives only 2Front LED screen flash is ok ok typeNot able to see in dark before clicking what exactly u r clicking..N also it's takes much time to process images, u have to remain steady for about 2-3 seconds after u captureI mean it should capture n process instantly but it takes much time to process the imageI miss notification blinker which was very helpful to meThey should have added but it's not there so unless u unlock ur phone u don't know u have received a notification or notM using this phone since 1 week n All I can say for now is evertym I m comparing it with my old phone vivo V7 i found V7 better than this.. only it has ultra wide mode which was not there with vivo"
413,kriti vyas,With updates it is getting more better.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my hands on this product on 13 August. At the beginning finger print senson was bad, camera was good and battery life optimization was bad as one morning I saw this phone just died overnight and only 1% was remaining but with updates today finger print sensor is not of much use face detection does a phenomenal job, even camera has started to improve not that anytime it was bad but just getting more better. Battery life has also improved with updates."
414,sajid abu,OnePlus nord is a great option to choose.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Here is my review about this mobile after using it for a week.Simply it's a nice mobile with all features that we expect from one plusOnly 2 negative points battery drain fast on normal uses it will run for a day.And you cannot play full screen videos on Amazon prime Netflix etc.Rest it's really nice phone. Go for it.
415,Neeraj,Quality not as expected from oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's been only 15 days and the screen showing blue spots.  Replacement date also gone.  These kind of manufacturing defects and low quality was not expected from oneplus. Quality has dropped exponentially.
416,priyabrat nayak,Please read carefully all negetive review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is very bad , serious buyer go for other brand /another one plus model just like 7T ...8.."
417,Dinesh vamsi,My 1st OnePlus phone and I like it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's my first OnePlus phone.It is very good.. but every phone will have some good and bad things..let us discussPros:-1)it's display quality is amazing and colours are vibrant...just when you experiencing such quality you wil defenetly impressed...it's display better than samsung phones(compared with A50)2) battery somewhat good.They providing 30Watt fast charger with in the box.It's a good thing.It is full charged approx 55min.3) oxygen os...  It's super.. didn't experience any lags while  using. Finger print scanner is fast and accurate.4)camera is super.great resolution pics are coming.5)even it is monospeaker it is loud than realme samsung phones.i am surprised.sound is descent.don't worry about sound.it's output is goodCons:-1)Battery somewhat draining fast.It will come below 10 percent if you use high brightness and high refresh rate by evening.if you on battery saver mode it will come till night.2)macro lens are waste.pics are not coming with high resolution.better to use main camera for macro shots also😌.3)there is a bug.if you go to settings for enable full display for Amazon and some apps,there are showing no apps.may be it will fix via update.Overall it's good for medium gamers and best for good performance..Defenetly you can use this phone for 3 years..Another thing is that I didn't observe any tint issue.But prize somehow it's little bit high.it is better to bring base model at 128+6,8+256,12+256Anyway I am satisfied with this device"
418,Laxman,Just a budget phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Budget phone
419,Vinu,One plus nord marble blue 12gb variant,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  ProsValue for money. I availed the Amazon exchange program as well. Hats off to oneplus for engineering this product. The 90hz panel is the best feature of the phone. The 765g does not feel slow at all. I have the 12g ram variant. Build quality is very good even though the frame is plastic. The marble blue color is beautiful. The stock android experience is really cool.ConsA little disappointed with the camera package. Though there are 5 to 6 of them, I feel they should have cut down on the numbers and focused on improving the wide angle lens and overall image processing."
420,Gowtham,Not a good Phone.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  If your are old Oneplus user you will be disappointed. I am sharing my view based on comparing my old Oneplus 5TIf you consider Camera this is not worth the upgrade from Oneplus 5, 5T, 6, and 6T Camera. (Take a pic with trees or plants in the background and compare)Sound (Speaker) is averageBattery life is same as Oneplus 5TOnly good think is display is smooth.Processor is slow compare to Oneplus 5T. Takes time to click and process the images initially is shows pixels in-the images after sometimes it loads.Apps repose is slow (Instagram, Olx, Facebook.)Network (JIO) Is not up-to the markIf you downloading something and try to use other apps its takes time to respondEven with the full network coverage Browser goes offline.Only with the Hype by saying 5G ready and Lesser availability there are marketing this phone.5G is minimum 1.5 yrs away think before buying this phone"
421,Irfan Jamal,Good Phone Overall with bad low light photography performance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is good overall. No performance issues whatsoever (it has beefed up specs, so yeah) and the good old Oxygen OS is snappy as ever. The display is good too (colors pop). The main camera (back camera) is great. It has a lot of detail, handles dynamic range well and the photos come out good (albeit a tad bit on the brighter side). The wide angle camera is okay at best. The macro, meh. The selfie camera is fine too (but struggles heavily under low light).Overall a good phone, with a good main camera (others are just ok)"
422,khushbu,Never settle with a faulty OnePlus Nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is not worth even  Rs.15000/- .After setting up the mobile, it was found that Power button is not working & mobile is not switching off. The display is becoming dim on its own & phone is heating up like hot cake & draining the bettery quickly."
423,Sanjay Kumar Jena,Good buy for the First time Amoled and 90Hz users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good phone having pros and cons equally. Camera is good except the macro cam which is completely worst and of no use even after 1-2 updates it's still the same. So if you put a black tape on the macro camera lens it will be better 😆, at least you don't have to see it then and regret.Next thing is display, which is awesome for me as it's my first Amoled display phone. Watching Netflix, Amazon Prime on this device is an awesome experience.Battery is decent as it has to be for a 4100mAh. Charging speed is something that I'm in love with. I have to keep an eye while charging it as I don't like to keep it unattended while the battery's become fully charged. So it's super fast charging.There is no heating issue till now but can't say anything about Gaming (pubg etc) as I don't play games on mobile.Bedtime mode which greys the screen sometimes doesn't work 🧐and I have to off it and then again on it then it starts working.Now the most important thing, tint issue and black bar. I think it's completely negligible in my device especially Tint, but there's a black strip in the line of front camera but its okay and not a big issue as shown by many YouTube reviewers especially those who doesn't get the reviewer unit😆.Video is something which I can say is AWESOME. Even if there is only one subject it is capable of Bokeh video shooting. 4k 60fps is mind boggling.At last waiting for the update when Macro can be actually give performance like a macro camera which is looking like an impossible task in near future.Plastic frame is a bit disappointing but with a case(other than the transparent case as it will turn yellowish in 1-2 months) one can prevent scratches.Overall it's a good phone and the hype created is somehow justifies the product but not totally so."
424,Siba chanda,"Using 1.5 month of My first phone, above 25k!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  AFTER USING ONE MONTH :-I got the delivery of this phone in 3rd August ( before 1day of launched). For this thanks to amazon. After using 1.5 month I am happy with this phone. In early time it seems a battery draining issue, but after 5 updateds in one month, now it is in a stable position. Now It's give you 7-8.5 hrs screen on time. It's fingerprint reader and face unlock is just lighting fast. Gameplay is upto the mark. There has no place to complaints. In fantic mode graphics and gameplay experience is actually enhanced. Camera is decent, not very good. In daylight camera performance is good, but in low light, it struggle. Selfie is also give you a decent performance. In daylight slow motion work properly but In low light , slow motion is just disgusting. The lights are blinking all the way in the video, for which you can't take any slow motion video in night. I reported it to the customer care of OnePlus and send them a video sample. They said to me, they give an OTA updated for this problem, but till now it is not solved by them. Except this, I don't face any issue with my phone.CONCLUSION:-This is a phone with 5g ready(which is currently waste, bcz in india there has no 5g). So, If you are looking for a balanced phone, not specialized in any section, want to experience oxygen os, take a phone for 5-6 years....then it is for you. Otherwise there are many phones in market in this price range, which are specialized in one catagory (like camera, processor etc).Is it helpful for you, then tap the helpful button."
425,Mani kandan,Which way .?? #nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Display - 90hz as usual smooth and amazing.Camera - Main camera not bad but got a system update for improved camera quality.Battery - As usual warp charge one plus best feature 70% - 30mins.Performance - Blazingly fast performance  no performance issues and added advantage fnactic mode for gaming purposes.
426,Faisal M.,Waste of money is worth only 20 k phone,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Display is OK doesnt look like a amoled display. Samsung m31 has far better display at low price. Nord is quick. Sound system is bad sound explodes it feels. Doesn't look like 90 hz either. Feels like a cheap quality one plus phone. Samsung m31 is far far better than this.
427,Gowthamm M,Read it full,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Moved on from redmi note 4 itself a big upgrade.Game: A little bit heats up while playing pubg. Am a light Gamer, hardly spend 1 hr. Heats up. After closing the game it will become normal.Fingerprint sensor: perfectly ok,but my right thumb work perfectly..but left thumb sometimes hit or miss even though my left thumb got two fp stored.Camera: It's good only. Processing takes time. Asusual two back and two front are good. No wrds any other two in back. Front gives you raw image in selfies. Low light need improvement. Overall Okayish. Not perfectPerformance: Top notch. Happy with it.Display: I just love it.Audio: goodBattery:  This is where I am disappointed sometimes. Needs optimization. 60hz seems to consume more battery hardly 5 hrs.UI: missed small small requirements. Like haptic feedback when someone attend the call, it will be helpful for many. Can't able to see daily data usage, small improvement. All will say this OS is good bla bla bla. Yeah it's minimal, Especially I am moving on from MIUI. That's y I am missing such things I used to, which is a basic requirements only. Out of 10 I will give 7...... Because of battery and processing speed of camera and need small improvement on OS"
428,dipak dehree,Disappointed camera performance better i bought realme x3,3.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus if you are hearing me this time I felt cheated because the camera hype was so much that it will be very good camera and just because of camera and one plus branding I purchased this phone and totally disappointed I am looking forward to replace it as soon as possible till I will wait for any updates regarding camera if they can do it before 27 August iw I'll be happy to keep this phone or I will replace
429,Chris Paul,Loved the Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall satisfied...I am not facing any issues like tint issue an be the Bluetooth connectivity issue. Í have been using this device since the 5 th of August and i am happy to say that Nord is definitely the value for money smartphone you are looking for.... The negative reviews are basically simply degrading the hyped ONEPLUS Nord.... I hope you guys would like the phone..  I feel its camera is not the best at this price segment
430,Jishnusuresh,Overall best phone under 30k but if perfomance and camera is your preference go for another device .,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.PROSSuper display { fluid amoled }Fast charger / battery backupDesign, weight, thicknessOverall good performanceCONS plastic framingMacro and depth no use worst cameraNo headphone jackWhile in dark mode you can face some colour issues in Google crome.If you are a gamer or like to get the best performance just go for realme x3 or redmi k20If you are a overall medium user you can go for it."
431,Sumit ,Fabulous!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best phone one can buy within a budget of 30k. I was pretty much confused at first, as there were many negative reviews about the nord, but finally I decided to buy the 12gb variant.And all I can say is it's completely worth it as i wanted a phone for multimedia purpose which requires good camera, good resolution in display, smooth performance. The nord completely meets my expectation.Battery could have been a lil bit better but also don't forget that the device runs in a 90hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to 60hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too, charges from 0-100 in around 70mins, which is quite good i suppose.People saying it's a over-hyped phone, it ain't, other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market!Go for it without a second thought, you won't regret."
432,Parth Timani,Budget King👑 | Oneplus Nord is Good option to buy under budget.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera quality of Oneplus Nord is Good for Daylight and Night. Battery life is also quite good and charging speed is so fast!But i think that it’s a good option to consider on Budget with Stock Android (Bloatware Free OS) and finally it’s 5G Phone so we can use it for future (Jio 5G)For more information about camera review watch My Video on iProTechHub.
433,Vicky soni,"West of money ,",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Note could have a much better improvement, but OnePlus did not pay much attention to it.  One is that its battery is given very little, which gets off very quickly, and the matter of display has been given to the display.  But it does not appear that it will be not displayed.  With this, the best display works in the country and the maximum problem is one of camera and the other of battery.  Once in a while the camera is never able to capture the photo.  Blocks most.  Photo and battery drains very quickly, so maybe Banda Plus had to pay very good attention to both these things.  The rest of the operating system is good.  works great.  There is no harm.  The fingerprint sensor is also good.  Its video stability is also very good."
434,Amit Dubey,Not worth,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera quality of the product is pethetic not even compete with 10000 phone in the market....don't purchase you will definitely regret about this.... Now both amozon and one plus answer ing my calls...not even able to return....
435,Divesh Singh,Best in it's Segment!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best phone in this Segment, Don't go with the negatives comment as they want everything in a 30k device, Camera is Upto Mark,  The 48 Mp. Main Camera does a pretty decent job and The main Oxygen Os for what people buy it for you'll love it. Go for it. It looks Premium."
436,Dinesh,Average Phone - Buy Power bank and camera along with this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus Nord tag line is true that, they have ""stolen the 48 MP camera from One plus 8"" If they would have bought from Sony and worked on camera software, Images taken from One Plus Nord could have been better as compared to other low budget Vivo / Oppo / Realme models (While all brands - Oppo/Vivo/Realme/One Plus/IQOO belongs to BBK Electronics, China)Battery is not upto the mark and full charge goes upto 8-12 hours on moderate or low usage. My 2 year old Honor view 10 gives more battery power then One Plus Nord."
437,Karan M,Awesome User Experience With Average Camera..,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dear All,I have been using this phone since 3 days with a very heavy usage. Here are some pros and cons :Pros1) Excellent display which is super amoled2) Refresh Rate 90 hz it's simply wonderful the way phone response to your fast typing.3) Battery is pretty decent even with a heavy and continuous usage like calls, music and 2 movies it last for 16 hours easily and it gets charged easily from 0 to 100 in 60 minutes which is pretty good.4) Finger print unlock and heptic feedback is next level.5) Sleek design looks stylish and one handed use is easily possible.6 And last but not the least one plus user experience is really awesome where you get to a lot of R&D with your phone where you can customise it as per your personality.7) Video quality is also very good, you can make really good videos.Cons :Just one why one plus why can't you get your camera straight where colors are punchy and pictures are sharper. Trust me if you do this you might be in direct competition with Apple."
438,navin prakash,Camera and battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Reviewing after 2 week of usesPhone is running buttery smooth and I haven't face any problem.2 Things I like to mention-Battery backup can be much better.-Their is no problem with camera(hardware) but the problem is with the image processing (software).When you shoot in RAW and then post process(LR or Snapseed) it then you get best out of camera.Nothing is perfect in the world go ahead and buy it. A good value for money phone at this segment.
439,Saravanan,Nords review after 1 month use,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Before this phone, i have used Redmi Note and that UI and features are far better than Nord model. Battery life is not at all good. The battery drains faster even in idle state.  Speaker quality is not up to the mark. Don't go with this model because of the brand name alone."
440,Abhaya Meher,great value for money deal... loved to having it... awesome performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,  im using the device since 20 days and my review for the device.Great value for money product with having a good mid range processor. 90 Hz fluid amoled display gives smoother experience. camera was awesome at the price point and believed to be software update for camera for more crisp camera quality...in love with OnePlus oxygen ui..
441,Ramya naik,Satisfied 😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seeing Few negative reviews I was worried about the phone . But trust me guys it's amazing phone. You just need to know how to take pictures . Few are saying camera is not as expected but it has got good camera , smooth functioning n also new update also . So I would recommend people to buy this product . even the video quality is good. As I'm a YouTuber , I feel happy about the phone camera ,display, light and sound too."
442,Vinay Rajput,No doubt just buy it...!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  *Design is super awesome*Handy smartphone*90hz display is super smooth and colors are vibrant*Camera is great in all modes*4k 60 fps front camera is just wow*Wrap charge do its job*Very simple and clean phone thanks to OxygenOs*Battery life is also good
443,Srishti $,Over-hyped phone! Camera issues.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got the phone some days back and I have mixed opinions about this. First of all the camera is not that great. You can get phones with much better cameras at this price range. Noticed frequent lags between pictures and the camera takes its own sweet time to process/enhance photos. The front camera does beautification of photos in artificial light which is a let down. Low light performance is bad (I am seeing this blue blur in the pictures clicked at night with artificial light and have complained regarding the same.) The side panel is fragile and prone to scratches. The fingerprint scanner is decent. I am not much of a heavy phone user but yes the battery drains out fairly quickly. The only saving grace is the Oxygen OS and hence a smooth normal user experience. I had Poco F1 earlier and now this and I won't even call it an upgrade. Its an overhyped phone. Not much value for money. Plus you got to invest extra for phone accessories!Maybe updates would solve some of these issues in future.
444,Arjun T,"Green tint, black bar and thin scratch",1.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this product. I waited for 6 days. I had a Samsungnote 8 earlier but this was much better. There's green tint with black bar and I thought I'll manage but the most distressing thing was that there was a thin long scratch as I removed the preapplied protector. I've sent for request of technician hopefully he addresses the issue and replaces it
445,Adarsh A.,2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing review after 2 week of use. I was very skeptical about buying it and also after buying it, I was thinking of returning it. The main reason being that in display, white appears little yellowish in every screen settings.But after using it, I found more pros than cons:1)Display is awesome. Colours come out real goods.2)Phone feels good too in hands but not better than MI A1.3)Camera is not bad, camera app is. Google Cam give far better results in the lower resolution settings (with the same camera). Although nightscape is better in stock app.4)No problem in gaming.5) Battery charges in about 70-75 mins fully from 0 to 100.6) In normal usage, battery last for atleast a day.7) In heavy mode, battery last for 4-6 hrs.8) Battery some times get warm even in normal use.Overall: Not good for photography and not best for gaming but this phone offers 2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does."
446,surendera B.,OnePlus for 29999  waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  When comparing with 7T camera quality is worst. 0Battery 1day 3times have to charge. On call connection with wifi. Battery drains 30min 2percent always keep an eye on battery.Other china make is far better With MI & Vivi.OnePlus for 29999  waste of money
447,anupam roy,The best ever phone in my life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My best mobile ever. So smooth like butter and I am feeling very happy to have one plus in my hand. Battery back up is just awesome, very first response, camera is very good, you can use both mobile data and wifi data simultaneously, you can instantly find an object by the help of Google lens inbuilt with the camera, nice feel of the handset when in hand, dedicated ringtone or vibration key at right side, dual channel network selection, dual volte, very good indisplay fingerprint sensor, you will get back cover in the box and screen protector already with the handset. If you are thinking a very good high end alrounder phone then you can purchase this OnePlus Nord, you will not regret."
448,Sumit,Better than before 🙂,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would like to say that the look and features of the phone is really nice but what I found missing is the notification light ,camera quality was not same as OnePlus other phone as m user of one plus 6 from last two year and most concern part is bettry life m not using this phone that much still the phone is sucking up battery so fast n taking time in charging also ....this is only my top concern otherwse feature is nice m not that much technical but whatever was in my last phone this is better easly can go for it no device is perfect rather u spent lack or thousands ull find any of lackness in something everywhere .....thanks amzon for best deals I got this phone at 26 k that is pretty gud ...my only concern is bettry pls let em know if someone facing same then I'll go for exchange 🥺"
449,Yodha singh,Wonderful,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Very good smartphone. Display quality excellent. Bettery backup very good.smooth OS no lags. am very happy with this and go for it .
450,Tathagat M.,I am loving the OnePlus Experience!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is worth it.Pros:1. Oxygen OS is butter smooth and the experience has been amazing.2. Screen is superb as well. Its a breeze to watch content on this screen.3. Battery life is great as well. For my usage getting almost 6.5-7.5hrs of SOT everytime.4. Fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate for 90% of the times.Cons:1. Camera could have been better. Dont get me wrong, the main camera(48MP) from OP8 is totally worth it. The other cameras are either useless or are not up to the mark. Selfie camera is also not that great if you compare to previous OP 16MP sensor.2. The mono speaker is loud enough but its not even near the amazing experience of 7T's stereo speakers. This is not a con but rather a wish that is unfulfilled.This phone has been worth the amount that I paid for it. I have received almost 5updates till now, which have improved the camera, battery etc."
451,AKHILESH TIWARI,Overall Good except Battery backup,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Fingerprint reader and Face unlock both are fast. Camera is not as per hype created before launch but it is decent. Processor is quite good. I am satisfied with everything except it's BATTERY. Nowadays almost all the smartphone brands are offering bigger batteries (>5000mah) but OnePlus has compromised with the battery in Nord. I have to charge twice in a day. As their charger (30W) is quite good so it gets charged quickly.
452,Sonu singh,Please Read review before but this phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looking good and hand feel nice, camera good, why audio jack missing in this phone? But oxygen os is superb experience you forget everything, but I am very disappointed why no Auto call recording is basics require on this time in every phone, please OnePlus improve it on immediate basis that would be great,And also battery backup not up to the mark.But dear friends you can go with this phone every thing is very good"

Heating issues after 25mts of usage and then hanging5 no proper response from Amazon customer care.6. Very very poor whatsapp video call quality."
454,Girish Rathode ,"Not phone a for 30 k , its really you are wasting 30k for a dummy phone!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Actually the cost will be around 10k r 12k. I have expected a good camera quality.2.Display issue.3.Battery Draining like hell.4. You cant use message authentication with google pay r any other app that recognizes auto OTP for a dual sim.  This the feature where it totally failed.5. Voice Assistance is not up to the commands are going wrong.6. The accessibility feature for Blind people is totally ignored, they cant use the , where the many cases are failed for that.7. All the youtube channels ( UNboxing ONeplus Nord )are sold because they didn't find out the issues and showcases the fake news abt the phone.it totally failed the product.These Chinese manufacturers proved they are good at selling dummy products."
455,Himanshu Pilkhwal,Expected the unexpected,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is as fast and efficient as one would want. The camera is subtle , the AI does a pretty nice job . The macro camera I haven't used much but didn't seem to be impressive . The front and the rear cameras are up to the mark. Dont expect it to be very zoom efficient, but it gets the job done in most of the cases. You will love the camera anyway . Night mode is super luminous in this phone ,you can't tell if it's a night or evening. Display quality , build everything is good but the battery is drained pretty quickly. Like with calls , WhatsApp & browsing it hardly lasts a day. the fast charger could have been more Efficient.  Also it doesn't feel like a 12 GB RAM phone sometimes"
456,Arpit Mittal,Shifted from Redmi fan to a One plus fan.!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well Honsetly Redmi had changed the market completely with their superior configuration and smart marketing strategy into delivering a decent budget phone.Having said that after using Redmi phones from past 4-5 years, needed a change and then came this mid- budget phone with extradinory specs and  premium design.Not to mention got it in steal deal price by exchaning my previous Redmi phone and the pre-order bank offers.Pros -Display and fingerprint reader - Well this was a big surprise for me as I had not been used to such beautiful effortless display which just follows your command as you want. It makes you feel that you are holding a premium phone without a doubt. Fingerprint reader is exactly at right position and works seamlessly.Speakers - Well some people are reviewing the speaker is not upto the mark but based on my experience the speaker is very good compared to my any previous Redmi phones I was using. In fact you would be easily satisy with the sound at 75% itself.Oxygen OS 11 - I was a Google nexus fan initially which used to give straight pure Android out of the box. Well this Oxygen OS is equally good.The balance between the original Android and the Oxygen OS 11 is very UI friendly and a new user will definitely feel a sense of friendliness with the UI. It has already got two major updates.Battery life - Again a plus point for an average mobile user.It easily spends complete day with me with lot of phone calls and what's app chats with good amount of juice still remaining durign the bed time.And what a charger man. Just 15-20 minutes of charging is required and this boost up like anything.Cons -Camera quality - Yes that's right. There could have been some mprovement areas in the camera section based on the price tag but still it does its part for a medium user.Headphone jack missing - Probably it's a new trend but it still pushed me to spend some additional bucks for a wireless bluetooth headphone.Overall It's a good budget phone which one should definitely consider it in this price range and it surely justify it's tag - Pretty much everything you could ask for.!!!"
457,Siddhesh Sawant,Must Buy !! A Complete overall package from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very good again from OnePlus. They manage to keep the trust of their fans once again.Pros :1. 90hz refresh rate with AMOLED display feels awesome.2. Oxygen OS from one plus has one of the best user experience in the Android Market at present. No unnecessary blotware or Ads3. Battery life is very good. With moderate usage it will last for a whole day or slightly more. For extensive gamers, it will give around 12 hrs of battery life. You won't complain about battery because of the Warp charge 30T. It will charge your phone to 100% in 52-55 mins.4. Dual selfie camera is outstanding. Can capture details very well alongwith a wide angle option.5. Main primary camera perform very Good. Sony IMX586 sensor captures details very well. Nightspace mode allows better photography at night as wellm6. Although there is a lower chipset in Snapdragon 765G, but trust me there is hardly a few milliseconds difference on comparing it with higher Snapdragon chipsets. You won't notice the difference until you are a very hardcore gamer7. Software Updates for 2 years is another welcoming thing with this phone.8. One plus alert slider is always a plus in its devices9. Great video recording options from both the front and rear cameras. OIS and EIS help you to record 4K videos with great clarity.10. No display Or Tint issues about which many people were concerned.11. Although India might not have 5G support right now, this phone provides 5G facility making it future proof.Cons :1. Macro camera doesn't seem to useful at all. It is just added for the sake of increasing the number of cameras on the device. Overall camera details could have been better.2. Plastic frame on the sides could seem to be a negative point considering Gorilla glass protection on both the front and back sides. Using a phone cover won't make you recognise it.Opinion : Although some features might not be the best , but when you look at the phone as a whole, it definitely is a complete package.I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a mid-ranger with a premium experience."
458,Abhishrey Singh ,Great Experience over the past 13 days,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well, this is my first experience with any OnePlus phone. i bought this 12Gb-256 gb variant and i'm impressed with the phone's daily performance. Earlier, I was using the Mi A1 for past 3 years and needed a change. Since I was accustomed to Android One I felt OxygenOs was the to go option for me this time around.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Smooth and easy to work around with customization and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro’s:• 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display is good and Battery lasts the whole of the working day(around 10-17% at the EOD).• OxygenOS Nothing Tops It.• Camera’s – Well, I do love taking snaps form mobile and work around with tweaks for everyday stories. I'm impressed with the image processing, the nightscape and the front cameras utility. The Image quality is quite good with respect to other Mid Rangers.• Stable video recording is a boon on this one. Perfect• Future Conscious 5g• Battery Performance is a big plus with the involvement of warp  charge.• Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – works fine and doesn't let you down while undergoing heavy usage. Gaming is quite okay.• No Display Issue. Maybe fixed over the second batch sales.• A prettymuch everything you could ask for.• Good Performance throughout the day.Cons:• The depth sensor and macro are literally not worth the promotions and hype they built for• Heavy users might not love this one.• No Headphone JackI don’t find more cons as of now"

461,Rohit Chouhan,it's not just one plus standard...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  it's midrange device so it's unfair to expect High which I realised after using it.First of all there are lots of,lots of minor bug in overall operations.Big issue including display tinting, camera performance, useless micro camera, battery optimization,and some stock Google apps for msg and calling which literally sucks.It seems this device is still in testing phase and not very stable.UFS 2.0 literally pathetic here, u can see loading in motion.I must say...it's just not one plus standard."
462,Bishal Ghosh,A reliable option !!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros-1. Smooth interface. (Oxygen Os)2. Screen is very good.3. Picture and video from the front camera is crisp.4. Video from the main camera is very standard.5. Internet speed on this phone is faster than my Honor 8 Pro over the same wifi network.  (Don't know the reason though)6. Can play the popular games without any hiccups.Cons-1. Pictures from the main camera is not upto the standard of a 28k phone.
463,Ajay,Overall best product in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received before the expected date, on Janmashtami. What an auspicious day to receive phone, its a gift to my wife. Temper proof packaging. Surprised to know that its manufactured by Oppo & good part its made in India.Basis usage on day one.Superb screen, bright colors, awesome lag free performance for 4k videos thanks to 8gb ram and super fast 765G processor which is Said to be among the 10best mobile processors Available in the world.Not observed any heating during full charging or playing videos etc. Got download speed of 4mbps Using 4g sim. Fast charging , full charge in 50 min. Camera quality is good. 2x zoom and 10x digital zoom. Good performance with flash for both front and back cameras under dark conditions, in my case there is no light in room. Though nightscape mode is available but not good and not clear pic. So use flash instead of nightscape mode. Disappointed with camera zoom And should have been better. Overall Fantastic performance For phone.Phone came along with silicon back cover but it smell too bad. So wash silicon back cover before use. Decent battery back up considering wifi, data usage vid play. OS is latest and meets the exoections. As promised by one plus received 6months of extended warranty. Suggest to purchase with Acko warranty.Finger sensor and face unlock still to be checked.Will update further with longer use of phone."
464,Prashant Doshi,Overall great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using Nord for almost 4 days now.General issues reported by others :- Many users have faced display issue, which I didn't face, not even slightly.- Camera quality is not that bad as shown in some reviews, though I'm not that much using camera. But still photos, from front cam and back cam are good and clear. Video recording is good.- some users have faced battery drain issue but not for me. I'm getting avg of 7 hrs SoT, with total of around avg 23 hours in single charge. In this 7hrs, I payed around 2 hrs of CODM, streamed videos for about 3hrs and rest general work. Also note that during this time, Bluetooth was connected all the time. So I'd say battery backup is good and if you don't play any games then it might last you around 9 hrs of SoT.- Fingerprint reader is fast and working good.Many are facing other issues but I haven't faced any of them including network problems. But if faced, you can go to community where they have shared some suggestions which might help you out.Also I haven't switched to 60hz, during all these usages, screen was at 90hz.Overall performance is blazing fast and device feels premium.Great experience using Oxygen OS. 90hz is feels very smooth.In a sentence you can say that it's great device."
465,rimi Ganguly,Absolutely worth it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Starting with the body and design... It's easy to handle and enables a firm grip.The fingerprint sensor could be faster but it does the job!The battery life is great. Charging is super fast and lasts a day easily despite heavy usage with multiple apps.The back camera in well lit conditions takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colours . The nightscape mode is brilliant as well. The front camera in well lit conditions or with flash takes amazing pictures.The only slight disappointment is the front camera in dark conditions without flash.All in all this is a great buy for the price and absolutely worth it :)
466,Vaibhav ,Superb phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros :1) Very good processor2) 90hz display makes scrolling very smooth3) Charging speed is good (30watt charger)4) Oxygen OS5) Build quality and looks6) Comes with pre applied screen guard and back coverAverage things :1) Camera is ok for the price range but not great2) Battery (4100mAH) is just averageCons :1) No headphone jackCons:1)
467,Chandrahas,Really bad camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased nord for my wife just for camera and oh boy camera quality is bad, indoors pictures are too much grainy, front camera quality is also bad.I tried to play with camera settings but still a bad camera phone.My wife's 3 years old moto Z takes much better photos.I already have oneplus 7T and it has great camera. But this time OnePlus let me down.I will try to return this.Edit: tried to request return, however bad photos is not good enough reason to return phone, a technician will check Phone and confirm if return is possible.Edit 2: So return was denied as grainy images issue is not a valid issue to return device.If camera quality is important to you, please look for other device."
468,mohit,Overall it is good for regular users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally I got one plus nord which is best middle budget from from OnePlus. This was not expected from one plus at all coming to pros and cons of phone.Pros:* One plus has provided 30T charger which helps to charge quickly it takes 0 to 100, 45minutes.* Display is fantastic provided fluid amoled display.* Refresh rate 90hz it's very fast and good experience.* Looks like premium experience.* Battery performance is absolutely fantastic.Cons:* Camera quality is not gud at this price we can get gud phones which was especially for camera, mainly rear camera 2MP was waste instead they might have replaced with 5MP seems good.* Build quality they have designed plastic frame seems worried.* Performance wise they have installed 765 Snapdragon with 5G technology, so at this price we are getting better performance phones like realme X2 pro.* There was no 3.5 ear phone jack and Dolby atmos.* Speaker was built down side of the phone so it disturbs a lot better speaker was built above the phone.* For gaming we cannot experience good.Overall, for regular usage and especially for people who are willing once a while with latest technologyI.e., 5G can go with this phone, those who are purposely purchasing for gaming better to go for other phones at this price."
469,Rashan s.,This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days.Pros- Amoled Display is very good from viewing any angles. The colors are so rich especially the blacks are really black.- battery.... After a week of use after heavy use it lasts for a day. But the charging technology oneplus uses is mindblowing. In 20 minutes of charge you will get more than 40 % battery charged.- cameras are really great work doing front and rear. Literally the videos don't have shakiness.-fingerprint sensor is very adaptive. So smooth and fast.  Don't forget to set your fingerprint before applying any screen protector.-personally i love the alert Slider of Oneplus devices.-Future ready Device this is 5G ready phone.Cons--missing the 3.5mm audio output jack. I have apple airpods so i dont need that 3.5mm jack. But you can purchase connector from the same.-Missing Stereo Speakers.-don't forget if you purchasing this device in 64 GB storage version. This device doesn't support expandable Storage. I have purchased the 256 GB version to get rid of storage problem.- macro camera sensor of this device worst. Don't try to use that 😜😜
470,Nikhil,Not happy with the product....to many bugs,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery drains too fastAll of sudden phone turns blank with one plus logo and come back to normal only after reboot is doneThis happend with me thrice in just 4 days of useIf you have any unsaved number you cannot find the number by just dailing last 3 to 4 digitI would recommend to wait and later buy this product once these bugs are removed esle no use of buying this phone instead you can go for samsung oppo in the same range
471,Ali Aman,The original segment of One Plus:,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....2. Camera: Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average.3. Display: Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. I have vivo z1 pro & Redmi note 9 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and this is only for 18k aprox. OnePlus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product. 2 rating giving for this. Otherwise features are good."
472,subhash prasad,Butter smooth but camera and battery life not upto mark in this range of 28k,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this phone in around 26.5K after applying bank discount and all.Over all experience is good but oneplus could have enhace its camera quality specially in low light condition along with battery performance well it last almost a day in case if minimal usase and last around 10 hrs in case of heavy usase.Please find below pros and cons.Pros :1.Phone performance is very good2. Display is good and nice refresh rate.3. Indisplay figure print unlick is quick4. No heating issue in a regular uses5. Good camera in outdoor condition6. Fast charging 1hr is sufficient to get 100%7. Red cable club membership - 6 months extended warrantyCons :1. Camera is not good in low light condition2. Price is bit high in this range other company offers snapdragon 8+ series but it has S7653. Heating issue while charging that we can ignore4. No headphone jack5. Face unlock is little bit slow (minor negligible)6. Back cover style is wired doesn't make any sense.7. Attract dust to much on fron as well as back need to clean everytime.8. No external sd card slot
473,rushikesh palshikar,Better Than expected ...Best Mid Range phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Premium Phone...Better Than Expected ...One of the Best Mid Range Phone..Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud.5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) The phone looks and feels premium while using.7) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.8) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The macro lens is useless, and the camera struggling at low light..Overall It's good..2) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.3) The plastic frame but it doesn't look like plastic but it is and it makes the phone *comparatively* less durable."
474,Ravimohan Kumar,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks pretty classy even being so simple in style. Display Experia is pretty smooth, camera isn't as other one plus but it's also pretty good at this price. Gaming performance is also good. Sometimes you will see a bit heating after high use but it's ok at this price."
475,Advaith,Balanced one which is getting better.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The device is beautiful.Charging speed is a major highlight.There are some software related issues which I hope the OnePlus team will rectify asap.Camera is fine except the macro.Also I didn't find depth sensor much useful.I prefer the gcam for portraits.i get an avg battery life of 6 to 7 hrs under optimised conditions.Front cameras are gud. The speakers are also loud.Also there are some connectivity issues with OnePlus buds.Speaking overall it is a great piece of tech.I like the overall design, weight and balanced output from it.I have been getting constant updates from OnePlus, which help the device better in many small ways.I took the 256gb variant which is a gud one and I would recommend it but if depends on person to person, so I have no storage issues till now.I was able to play pubg at hd graphics which was great, like I was satisfied.Other games also run well, like pretty smooth.Heating up is there but insignificant if you don't play at a stretch.I have been having some troubles with a few apps but as I said they are rectified.I am enjoying it.👍"
476,Harsh Shah,4.7 / 5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sharing my review based upon experience of 5 days using Oneplus Nord Grey Variant (12+256)Classifying the major aspects in average, good and superb.1. Body - Good. Feeling like having premium mobile in my hand2. Battery - Superb. After my office time of 9 hours, battery was still more than 50%.3. Performance and processor - between Good and superb. Few times it took 3-4 seconds to process galary. Might be becasue I had kept 60Hz. I am not gamer, so idea on that part. Overall, very smooth.4. Camera -Oh my god..so much hype there.1. Primary camera - extremely superb. I do not use macro camera. So no comments on that. Picture quality even in 12 MP is awesome.2. Front camera - Well. Here I will say average. Little bit whitish issue. Hope it will be improved in future updates. Video quality in both cameras - SuperbWhere it could have been better ?1. 3.5 MM jack - not there2. LED light for notifications - missing3. They could have provided beast front camera to just eliminate competitors. However, it's not that bad. Pretty good selfies.Highly recommended 👍👍"
477,Joell Mathew K,"Great phone,but",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera is not that great as the pixel 4a, but for this price range I doubt any other phone can add up to this currently. This is a great buy or if u can wait, wait until the 4a hits Indian markets.. the OnePlus is a fast,fluid,amazing phone. I own the 12gb version, if anyone is looking to buy this phone, I would recommend getting the 8gb or 12gb version because this phone has slower ufs 2.1 storage(approx 18 sec slower than ufs 3.0),this means that loading games and application are slower and in the long run it would get even slower, so go for the bigger ram versions, also there is no sd card slot so it would be better to get the bigger storage versions.All this and my 12gb version is heaven,for this price range, at this time I could not find a better phone that looks good and performs well also. But if anyone can wait for the pixel 4a, go for it."
478,ajitabh s.,Technical errors in one plus nord,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi, I purchased one plus nord on 31st aug sale since i am facing 2 problems with it. First is while searching on google sometimes it tells you are offline despite of having adequate signals, i never faced such problem with my other mobiles at aome location.Second , mobiles becomes automatically silent wothout any change in setting, it happened many a times with me , when i mossed many calls because ot becomes silent automatically.Furthermore one plus  customer support system is very poor , i am trying to contact since i have purchased it but all the time customer service number remains busy. I have mailed also about the problem but didn't get any reply till."
479,vikrant shende,Average mid-range phone with 5g. Not at all worth the hype.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera:  Quality (both front & back) not like a flagship as hyped by OnePlus. Macro and depth are fake. Front camera problem is after clicking you have to stay still for about 2 sec to get clear image else get blur. Main cam and ultrawide are ok in daylight and struggle in the night.Display: slight red and green tinting can be observed in dark.Performance: is good for day to day normal use.Battery: is sufficient and charging speed is good.Overview: Overall ok phone if u want 5G go for it. Cameras are disappointing. Display could have been better. Price should have been 20-24k.OnePlus flagship phones are better. I find my OnePlus 5 better than this.
480,Amit Kumar Ghosh,Pity much Amazing !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Yes. It is one the best mobile phone within this price range. In-spite of all other reviews, I wanted to try this out by myself and it's comes up amazing in every corner.2. Obviously it's having some cons but it can be overcome with your smart move. For example: every where it was told that camera performance not up-to the mark. believe me or not but it's really minor which you can modify. use google cam if not happy with stock camera app.3. Best part of this phone is having same Oxygen OS like onplus 8 & oneplus 8 pro. If you are 1st time user for this kind of android, then my recommendation is try any stock android with google phone or Oxygen OS with Oneplus. You will feel the the differences with other phones.Won't say any more.. Better you try this out then say anything.. if not like it you have 10 days return policy."
481,Shrutika J.,Sleek design with premium feel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivered on 24th AugDisplay - good, no tint or spots yet.Speaker - loudCamera - Average or above (depending on lighting conditions)Battery - Average.Wrap charger - Approx 30-45 mins for full chargeFingerprint reader - works fineWish it had 3.5mm audio port."
482,Kavita,"Average camera ,great processing",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I feel it's an average phone as per the price, the processing is good, but i feel the camera which is the major factor for this phone isn't that good it take decent picture on full light but does extreme on medium light and i feel it highlights the shadows more than its needed.The back is glass which requires extra protection and camera isn't the first priority of yours it's a good phone."
483,Amazon Customer,Worth to buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst packaging ever . When I saw this item I was completely shocked. I thought my item must be damaged . But the phone was completely safe and nowhere damaged. I hope Amazon should improve the packaging and made it premiumNowPhone is goodDisplay is excellentCamera is pretty goodOxygen OS is marvelousOverall performance is goodLittle bit heating issueSometime camera is taking time after taking multiple shots
484,Amazon Customer,It's the best 5G ready phone in Market with this price. Must Buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   It's an awesome phone and best in class with the price it has.First and foremost I would like to clear all of you that there is no pink tint issue or camera black breakout issue with the phone, they were just rumors.I have uploaded the video checking the same by my own with device I have purchased.No such issue, and camera quality is absolutely fine I must say.Pictures I have clicked from my front selfie camera are almost level of DSLR clicked.If anybody or any tech reviewer mislead you towards tint or black crash rumors, I will suggest that please buy and check by your own.Amazon have very easy return policy.So buy and check.If you don't buy, you will miss a great 5G smartphone in lowest of price.And again it's Oneplus.No doubt at all,I am one plus user since 2015, one plus two, 6T McLaren edition and now Nord 12/256.No one can beat them for sure, they are real flagship killers by the virtue of quality and hardware they provide."
485,Aakash,A decent buy with some shortcomings,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. You ll be surprised but battery back up is not at all good, charging covers it but bckup is very bad.2.Macro and depth camera's are pretty useless and to my surprise selfie camera doesn't even compare with redmi note 7pro it is that bad in low light, unnecessary boost and contrast.3.There is huge gap below keyboard, could be fixed via update but oneplus isn't doing the same.4. Performance is very good, no lag no complains..UI is smooth and perfect, Dark mode needs improvisation though.Overall if you don't have any urgency don't go for this phone, all the issues could be improved with software updates but let us hope oneplus does that."
486,Amazon Customer,Good phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I exchanged op-6 for this phone. Very much satisfied with the processing power . Spectacular improvement in display quality. Sound is also very good. Weight balance is very good ,I didn't felt it is of 184 gm. I am satisfied with it.Camera needs to be improved. Too many blurry images.Battery improvement is not satisfactory.I am getting little more usage time compared to op-6."
487,Amazon Customer,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought Nord with 12GB+256GB configuration.Some of my observations are:1.Its a single SIM phone2.Do not have 3.5 audio jack (No wired earphones)3.got heated while updating apps for the first time, after that no heating4.camera quality is superb5.No screen lagging due to 90Hz amold display6.It really has premium look.7.it's the best combination in this price range.Overall rating9/10"

489,Umesh Vani,Not upto the mark. Disappointed.!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  After usage more than 10 days my reviews:1. 90 hz refresh rate is good but due to low processor phone lags sometimes.2. Camera quality is ok, but not upto the mark what i thought about OnePlus.3. Heating issue is there for continuous usage of 4-5 applications some time. And it takes few minutes to cool down.4. Battery drains faster. For continuous usage need to charge twice or thrice a day. And takes around 1.5 hrs from 20 to 100%5. For gamers is not good choice. Phone lags during heavy game. And refresh rate is not as they said. Things happened in the game reflects after 4-6 seconds.6. During video call phone speaker automatically turns off and it goes on earphone mode. (Very irritating while video calls). Becomes difficult to hear at earphone mode and than talk on video.7. Most of time my number shows out of network. Don't know why.? It was not same issue in my old phone. Sim chipset might have some bugs."
490,MANJEET SINGH CHOUHAN,Awesome,4.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus nord (8+128)I got this phone around 27000 with ICICI BANK 1000 rs Cashback offer. I want to buy 12+256 but that was not available onsite at the time so I purchased this 8 +128gb with oneplus bullet wireless earphone. The colour is quite good.fingerprint sensor is awesome is responsive and fast.I just changed from 10000 phone to 30000 rs and it's my first expensive phone.Battery life is somewhat I can say negative point in this but I have to charge 2 times per day. But with the help of 30 word it can charge so fast.Camera quality is very good in this price.Display is also very ee islii colour optimised so it's quite good to see a big display with oneplus AMO LED.Front dual camera is also good in this segment.Blue colour is quite awesome and very cool.I was just confused with the colour option but finally about the blue one and it's awesome really awesome so don't think just go for it.
491,sandeep Kumar,Better choice of smart phone alway and misbehaviour of customer care,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Best phone ever good to buy .... everything is ok but I m very disappointed with customer care executive ( Abhishek and Sayantoni) they give me bad and wrong commitment and misguide with product delivery date and time also not able to resolve the query....and also without my permission  my product is rescheduled..still disappointed from Amazon customer care service.
492,iliyas shaikh,Great choice to go with,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   The device is Amazing.. People expect alot from Oneplus n which is why they critisize if something is not according to their will however these are the same people who buy iPhone SE2 iPhone xr,x,11 for 40,000 n happy woth feature half then what Nord is providing themCamera potrait mode is meeting the expectationsMacro camera is just the beginning of reaching different league in midrange.Wide Angle is great at time a bit weird..No green light on 90Hz which everyone is claiming looks like oneplus fixed the issue..As its 12Gb Ram no lag good at multi taskingBody is good need more colors available like green, purple,intersteller,lavender..Battery drains quickly as Im a heavy user it doesn’t come to me as a surprise or shocker...Loving the overall feel of the phone.. this is a phone better then Oppo Reno latest series, iphone SE2,Xr,11"
493,Kindle Customer,Things not expected from OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good but its over priced only because of brand. Battery life is not great and lack of headphone jack hurts. Phone heats very quickly and camera quality of rear side is more than average but not great. OnePlus has not given many features in this device like it gives in other devices, kind of lighter version of Oxygen O.S is used."
494,harish b.,Battery And Heating Issues,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Hi I have order 12gb Blue marble OnePlus Nord by amazon on 6 Aug. I got this device on 8 Aug from that I faced battery issues draining very fast also for 5mins YouTube video surfing the mobile getting heat as much. I can't able to tolerate this from oneplus and also I have spent 30k for this device. I have contacted amazon technician team they told to install blancco app and they checked there is a battery problem and heating issues. And they told sir this time we can't replace your device due to no stock. They registered complaint against for replacement ones the device getting back in stock. But my available time is 20 Aug. Please resolve my issue and give a replacement device for this device.Apart from the battery the mobile is premium while using. We definitely feel the flagship experience in OnePlus Nord. I appreciate OnePlus for this smoothness. Only drawback is battery otherelse mobile is awesome.

497,Swati,Worst phone I ever had,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is a nightmare for heavy users. You need to carry the charger wherever you go. The front camera is pathetic. Reminds me of nokia 6600 I used 15 years back. The apps start on their own and it hangs a lot. Talked to customer care and followed their instructions, still behaves the same way . Amazon please take this phone back."
498,Rithwik Joseph,"A Steal For Under ₹30,000",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review is being written after 2 weeks of usage with the phone. In a nutshell, I would say that the phone has performed extremely well for me. I will list out the pros and cons here from my experience over two week.Pros:1. The Snapdragon 765G processor coupled with the 12GB of RAM helps the phone run very smooth. Other than the occasional negligible hiccups experienced on any phone, I do not have any complaint about how smooth the phone is.2. Fortunately, my device has not yet experienced any kind of screen tinting or black bar issues.3. The 90Hz refresh rate is so satisfying to use. Though inferior to 120Hz displays, it barely makes any differences in terms of watching YouTube videos or so.4. The 765G processor is indeed optimized for gaming, as I was able to get a smooth experience with Call Of Duty with Graphics and Frame Rate maximised. I did not experience any kind of lag. Other games like PES and Asphalt 9 were also running very smooth for me.5. The 30W Warp Charger is indeed pretty fast. I usually charge my phone from 30-100% and it takes somewhere around 30-40 minutes for this.6. There is hardly any bloatware on the phone and most of the pre-installed apps can easily be uninstalled at your convenience.7. The Colour Saturation on the screen is pretty well managed and you even have various options to adjust that to your preferences.Cons:1. The battery life is something that I am a little disappointed about. If you are looking for a phone which can get you through the day with occasional surfing and videos, then definitely go for it as it can stay alive for an entire day without recharging, but if you are a gamer, then I suggest you look for alternatives as games tend to drain your battery quite a lot.2. Camera wise, I would say it is good, as the 48MP main camera does capture good quality pictures with proper colour saturation and details, but when it comes to the wide angle camera, sometimes, the edges seem to blur out a little, thus reducing the detailing. The Depth enabled sensor is also pretty good, though sometimes it suffers in recognizing the foreground and background and may blend in together, though majority of pictures came out pretty good. It is better not to talk about the macro lens as they are way below average. I would suggest anyone to not use them, instead click with your main camera and crop out and you are guaranteed better quality pictures. Low Light photography is also average as most of the pictures are grainy, but the nightscape option makes the pictures look fantastic even in low light. The selfie camera was also good as it captured some quality pictures.3. While gaming I did experience a negligible amount of heating, though it could have been due to other factors.4. The plastic frame of the phone is a drawback, though a quality bumper case would solve that problem once and for all.Barring these few drawbacks, I would recommend the phone to everyone mainly because OnePlus is very punctual in rolling out system and security updates. Also there are many inbuilt features such as the one that automatically suppresses notifications while gaming."
499,Aviral dobhal,Its just a normal phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So i was really excited for my first one plus phone but only thing special about it is oxygen os everything else is just ordinary.CamerasMain camra and ultra wide cameras are really good. Although I am not able to see difference between 12 mp and 48 mp photosPortrait mode photos are below average. Very poor edge detection. My old phone with single camera detecte edge better that this one. 90% times i didn't get a good photo with nord. 1 photo attachedMacro camra is just there its of no use. Personally i think i will never use it but even if anyone want to use it its of no use it captures blurry photos all the time.Selfie cameras are very good they don't beautiful you and capture great photos. Both look really good in good lighting conditions but in low light ulrra wide capture little darker imagesTime lapse is good slow mo is average and night mode also goodOsOxygen os is excellent with some unique and cool features like changing accent color. Only one problem i feel is that it uses lock screen password for app lock which iam not a big fan of.Blotware pre-installed. The one you can uninstall are Facebook, Insta, amazon and some one plus apps. That you can not uninstall are Netflix, YouTube music.BatteryBattery on nord disappoints me the most. I use 90hz refresh rate. Its get me total stand by time of 12 to 13 h With screen on time of about 6h. That mean if i charge phone in the morning i have to charge it by end of the day again and i don't even play games (screen shot attached).Charging is great it charges 0 to 100 in about an hour if not using it. And around 1h 15 min if i use it during charge.DisplayIt look beautiful. And with 90hz its its really fast on scrolling through insta. And i don't have any tint issue with it. I am glad i didn't choose another lcd panel phoneOther thingNo notification led is really a pain. Hope one plus provide always on display soonNo headphone jackFingerprint and face unlock is fast and reliable didn't face any single issue with them till now.Speakers are loud and clear. Not to loud but i can say it's above average.Haptic  is cool.Design feels good and premium. And the form factor is just perfect.Google phone really suck. I cant record call without informing other person in the call. It give a loud warning when starting call record that other person can also hear.Phone runs smooth no issues with the performanceso the only disappointed for me is battery life and portate mode shots. I hope it get fixed with ota as promised by one plus on forum"
500,Ashwith Aithal,Best all rounder!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered on 6th and delivered on 13th as promised by Amazon (Thanks to all the hype and demand). No complaints there!!.Have been a OnePlus customer myself in the past and having used other OnePlus phones, the nord does the same and gives that premium OnePlus experience for sure.Keeping specs aside, let's talk about the pros and cons from the daily use point of view.The Pro's:- Great in-hand feel. Feels premium.- Quick, responsive and lag free user experience,  thanks to great mid range processor and we'll  optimised OxygenOS.- Decent and Loud enough sound quality from  bottom firing speaker as well as headphones.- Best in class haptics for that premium exp.- Great AMOLED display with excellent colors. (There is no visible green tint. It's is just an  overrated issue. If you at all there is a green tint in the device , it is only ever so slightly visible at very low brightness in a pitch black room with a grey background only. So no need to worry there)- Good main camera and ultrawide camera. Also  the front cameras are excellent.- Good call quality.- Great sensors.-Great battery life. Got an average screen on time  of 6-7 hrs on decent usage (calls, video streaming,  music listening, social media consumption). I personally don't play games so the battery life is not a issue at all. Even if you are a gamer, you should get 5 hrs of screen on time.- Superfast charging. It literally charges full in less  than one hour.The Con's:- Useless 5mp depth and 2mp macro camera. It is  just of no use.- There is no headphone jack, which may bother  some people.Verdict:If you are looking for a phone that looks and feels premium, is quick and responsive, has gud battery life and charging times, can take good photos and has great software support, then this the phone for you.A Best All rounder !!!"
501,chetan,Works for me,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I have been using this phone constantly for the past 3 days and here is my honest opinion:1. Camera could have been much better for this price. There are ton of phones out there in lesser price with better camera. But as this feature isn't my priority I won't be returning.2. I had been using Moto g4+ for the past 4 years and my usage is not that heavy so my priority was to get a good software (as close to the Google's version as possible). So far, I'm really liking oxygen OS and as promised it isn't bloated. The phone is smooth and since I bought the 8 gb ram -128 gb variant, I won't be needing a sd card so I can use 2 sim cards.3. Battery life is actually lesser than what brands like Realme or even Moto gives in this range but because of 30 watt warp charger, it isn't a huge issue for now. Will recommend getting a powerbank if your usage is heavy and have no nearby power outlet for most of the day.4. There is no tint issue in my phone and I'm not a gamer but I have noticed that the phone does slightly heat up after reboot from software update and once even heated up in Ludo. So if you're a gamer, I don't recommend this.5. The face unlock and fingerprint reader isn't very smooth. My previous phone had a fingerprint reader separate from the screen which felt more convenient. Also you would need to get bluetooth earphones as there isn't an audio jack so make sure you have the budget for both.Apart for this I'm really enjoying this phone. I don't have any experience with newer model phones but compared to my 4 year old moto phone, this feels definitely like an upgrade software and hardware wise and hopefully this phone will last long too."
502,Alaric lewis,A phone that just keeps getting better with time!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A well balanced device..I am more of a performance guy , so at first, when I saw all the hype, specially about the cameras, I wasn't sure if I should buy this for just for the camera. So I did some research (a lot of actually)... Waited for a week after sale, so that I can get all the hands on reviews, the good ,the bad ,etc.One thing that I found was :-The specs were Good, not the best but Good enough.The camera had scope for improvement.The OS was the best part..A Great Screen...the tinting issue is very minor dosent affect anything for me personally. (not a OnePlus fan but still the issue isn't even noticeable)The biggest thing that made me buy this were the software updates ...I have been using the device since ....like the first update.... And it's just been getting better and better... An example of this would be...When I used the device after the 1st update I could go through 24hrs with 20-25% battery remaining at the end of the 24hrs...(screen brightness at avg 45%..screen at 90hz....normal useage....some gaming...some insta /msging...some entertainment...etc. )Now that's improved significantly..I get like 35-40hrs to get my device down to 20%...The updates have been addressing the camera issues too...but since I am not much of a camera guy..I can't provide much feedback on it...but for me personally....the camera seems good ..All in all... This device is only getting better!Good work OnePlus..... (PS - I hate the facebook app Installer bundled with your devices..).."
503,Souparna Supriya Banerjee,Seems like Nord hasn't been extensively Tested!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything is great except the speaker.The recipient of the call is hearing all kinds of noises and disturbances.And as discussed with amazon technical support representative, this problem is occurring for about all users.Hoping for a quick fix or a replacement of the product."
504,Muzammil,Oneplus Nord folks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using this mobile for 15 days ,I can strongly recommend people you can buy this mobile without any doubt.Camera -- looks good which is fine at this prcie range don't compare to High end mobile but believe this mobile will not disappoint you.Fingerprint -- sometimes you feel it's not that fast reader. But am satisfied with this.Battery -- I felt it's okay 4115 mah for the normal users but for gaming lovers you need minimum 5000 mah battery.Why you should buy one plus nord at this range--Pros :1. Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor.2. 90hz refresh rate which is really awesome.3. Warp charger - no heat issues.4. Camera is good not best.5. It comes with pre installed Oxygen OS.6. Design and build quality of this mobile is great but I would recommend all to please put back cover which can help you to keep the mobile in safeside.7. Price is good for 12gb ram and 256gb rom variant.Cons :1. while you play pubg little amount of heat I can feel hope this may improve in coming updates.2. Camera quality have to improve in next updates.3. No wireless earphones provided by the company which is really bad for 30k mobile they must have some plan for the customers because again we need to pay at least 2k for the wireless earphones.Conclusion--- this mobile gives you best experience and am happy to recommend all you please try this out at 30k this is best."
505,suraj,Nothing exciting in this phone. Fake hype.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is pathetic. Even in very light usage it drains in one day. Display is not at all good. You can compare good dslr photos in monitor(real view) and then compare on nord n also in other phones. It's pathetic. Skin tones are very off. Shadows are too dark. Even the display is not at all bright. Seems like using a cheap phone. Fingerprint is bit slow many times. Battery, display & camera is not good. Rest performance is good. Nothing great in this phone but a decent. Hype is just a waste."
506,shubham bijekar,The killer Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great phone from OnePlus.1. Camera is great in outdoor conditions. Indoor seems to be dull.2. Smoothness of touch is great.3. Display is just awesome4. Charging is very fast. 10-100% charges is 55 mins5. Speaker sound is not that great6. Selfie camera is best. OIS and EIS are greatOverall great performance no lag played pubg and asphalt.
507,tushar maji,Could be better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using the phone since last 7 days, Doesn't feel any problem with build(though frame is plastic).The only things bother me1. Display tint(not visible in total black image, but visible in chrome darkmode)2. Low light picture quality3. Unnecessary macro & depth camera.4. Though the launch is AR launch device doesn't support Google AR core(WTF OnePlus)."
508,Soorya Raghuraj,Neither a Flagship nor a Killer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Unlike what OnePlus had profoundly mentioned in their Amazon portfolio, the camera is ANYTHING BUT FLAGSHIP! 2MP macro is a ""2020 Joke of the Year"". Primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth. Under low light conditions, it just gives up. About selfie cam, don't even get me started. Overall, all SIX cameras suck.Processor is fast, but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet. So, gamers.... DON'T invest here.Battery lasts a day on medium usage. If you are a heavy user, DON'T buy this phone. 90Hz refresh rate drains battery even faster. Wanderlusters, please keep the charger and an ELECTRIC SOCKET handy. Recharging is quick. Very quick.Fingerprint reader is fast, if not superfast like those physical ones. So unless you are stupid, refrain from comparison.Oxygen OS in one word: AWESOME. This was one of the major reasons why I purchased this phone. Bloatware free UI is something I had craved for. I hated those unsolicited ads on Xiaomis and Oppos and Honors et. al. Also, a near-flagship from Samsung or Apple was out of question as I like my kidneys more.Long-story-short: Touch, look and feel is premium. Great UI. However, if you are into photography, gaming, wired-music-maniac (I own a TWS, so don't really care), or really tight on budget, DON'T get this phone. Rest choice is yours."
509,Ajay Sharma,I request pepole to not buy this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all I would like to say that this time seriously I did the mistake to bought this phone, honestly I am telling that before got this phone I was extremely excited because in my life this the is first expensive phone for me and that too one plus but when I got this literally I can not explain that what was I m feeling because my friend have one plus phone and I have used the phone of my friends so when I first time took into my hand I feel like what is that why I bought this why I waisted my money on this but now could not be done anything, you never feel like it's one plus phone screen is too small and I am not a heavy user and I only use the phone call sometime browsing but for that also it's not giving me expected battery backup as I am using one other phone where in the battery is only 3400 mah and that one is giving me battery backup better then this and the most important thing which was seriously not expected from one plus that is camera and its seriously bad bad bad even 13 mp camera phone is better then this guy's seriously I am telling you please do not go with this it's waisted of money now I wish to return this phone but nobody is listing my word and I can't return it so now it's pain to use this phone and seriously you never feel that you are using one plus mobile its feeling like normal phone only and I will never buy any one plus mobile now in my life."
510,Asish K.,Overall a great package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall its a nice oneplus package at this price, more of it, it has 5g.My review on Nord:1. Camera's colour processing is not upto the mark. You will notice this most while capturing indoors, as pics look bit faded. Camera processing takes a bit time for front camera so u have to hold the camera for a second after hitting shutter otherwise it will be shaky.2. Device is provided with Oxygen OS, the best android skin. Oxygen OS really feels smooth as butter and has a lot of handy features, the best part of it is the oneplus listens their community concerns and provide updates accordingly. But the thing I don't like is the device uses phone, message app provided by Google. So nord users will miss many features that oneplus phone and message app provides.3. Macro lens is useless, a telephoto lens should be provided instead. For macro shot u can try pro mode with manual focus and zoom.4. Battery is not that great but its the fact u will like that it gets fully charged within an hour.5. The display looks great. The most hyped display will be there in every amoled display with high refresh rate but no need to worry u will never notice that in ur day to day usage.6. Phone gets heat up a bit while charging but its not much. Its normal as ur phone gets charged so fast and its getting charged with 30watts."
511,Pranjal Sharma,Overall Package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yeah finally reviewing after almost 1 month and i can say this is a good phone under 30k where you can get pretty well software(Oxygen OS), decent battery, Nice smooth display, good fingerpint and last but not the least OK camera. It's camera performance is not the best and it's overall good with 4k60 fps Selfie video which is ultimate and also picture quality is good enough in day light and average in dim light.So what i can say is if you want to get rid of Redmi realme and can't but upper segment of OnePlus, this is a good decent phone. You can compare your needs with Oneplus or Samsung phones since those are also comes with good specs. But personally i don't like Samsung phones , so i have gone with Oneplus Nord.So yeah that's it.Thanks!!"

513,Sanjay,Decent midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The photos u saw are from gcam.Let me divide this review I will try to cover as many aspects as I can.Display: Pro:Display is superb and really good.altough I didn't notice any difference between 90 and 60hz.Con:The display has a green tint issue and every oneplus Nord has. But it did not affect our daily usage.Design:Pron:glass back feels premium but I wish it had a mattle back.Con:it has a plastic frame so not very durableOs : should I right about it it's just a waste of time it's the bestProformance: good actual it's great with oxygen osGood gaming no lags noframe drops good.Con: it does not have 8 series chipset but I do not feel the difference.Features: mono speaker but sounded greatVibration is decent although I wish it could be better5g nothing to talk about itPrice : I think it's pretty good special for 12gb variat.Camera: camera sucks front and back both camera sucks it's just take shitty pictures.Oneplus plz give upates plz.Nord vs garbage phone likes k20 pro, realme x3 series.Nord is way way better than this phone.Nord vs x2 proU might be think that the x2 pro better on specs yes it is indeed and I think it is a better phone for gamers but for all other people(include me) who game a little or do not game Nord is better .Nord vs 7tSpecs are better on the 7t but it is worth rs.10kThink yourselfNord vs 8I was really confused between the two and for rs.17k here what the 8 addsBetter performanceBetter speakersCurved displayGood vibration motorBetter ultrawide cameraAlse everything is same .Nord vs a71Though choice but NordIt's simple really that simple it all comes down to really experience in which we have a new midrange king and it's the Nord"
514,Anubhav Majumdar,"Awesome model with excellent display, superfast charging and the best OS",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using Nord for one month now and my overall experience is awesome. I would specially like to mention the fast charging option OnePlus provides us with its Warp Charging technology which is really superfast compared to other mid-range sets. Battery life is decent. Some other significant things are its superb display which comes with 90 Hz refresh rate and obviously the cool and compact design with two uncommon colour options which gives a feeling of having a flagship model. The best thing about OnePlus is its supercool Oxygen OS which is undoubtedly the best in the industry right now. You'll also get various online storage benefits, subscriptions and discounts with your Red Cable Club membership in any OnePlus set. Gaming performance is okay, but needs to be more optimized. Processor is fast enough for multi-tasking and professional editing purposes and it comes with built-in 5G technology. The camera quality and image processing are good enough for casual photographers, although it's not recommended for professional photography. Nightscape mode is outstanding. The mono speakers are okay. Overall I would give 90+ out of 100 to this exciting OnePlus Nord model. I have also shared a couple of photos which I clicked using nightscape mode. Check those out. All the best."
515,vasim,"Read Fully, Disappointment",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First, many suggested me not to buy this product after the release week, but I went for it due to the trust in company and ordered.Now, I recieved my mobile few days ago and found out huge problems... Below is the list.1. Snapchat :- The app layout in Nord(12/256) is so basic that it portrays the layout of a low end 5000/- mobiles.. the Bitmoji clarity is soo bad, pictures taken are always blurry, and you wont be abled to attend live filters, you should take picrures and then apply them.2.Whatsapp :-  Now a days video calling is the most common form of telecommunication, but the clarity of video call in Nord is very worse than ever.The video is dark and you could see the black outline all over the image processing at the back camera.In case of front, there is an smoke effect in front camera which reduces the clarity completely.3. Oneplus features :- Many old features of Oneplus had been removed here like (shelf, dock, etc)4. Camera Quality :-  The camera clarity is average, but there is a huge amount of grain in camera where it completely destroys the image quality.Front camera is worse..Others are common problems faced by all mid rangers.. like battery, Gaming, RAM handling etc"
516,sirisha,Very disappointing product..North worth buying,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yesterday i have recieved mine...i have few issues with this mobile.....1.As soon as we click a picture from front camera we need to wait for some time with out moving phone to not have a blurry image...even a very lowest price phone doesn't have this backdrop they capture a non blur image as soon as we click and move phone.2.The battery back up is not as expected as i have been using one plus 6t, we checked both one plus 6t as well as nord at same usage from 100% charge and nord drained so fast where one plus 6t didn't.....3. The back swipe is lame its not working as expected everytime we need to swipe twice /thrice to go back....better if we change it to swipe up from either of the ends as all other one plus have.....4.when ever we click pictures infront of the mirrors the pictures are coming very bad with 0% naturality....not expected this from one plus.....very disappointed i have suggested my sis as well as my friend to buy one plus nord  as i was using one plus from very long time and i trust one plus....after receiving nord i seriously dont suggest nord to  anyone.....very disappointing actually..... if possible please resolve all of them with an update....on the second day of usage i have an issue with the main apps where it shows a blank page and not displaying any apps......"
517,Indrajith,Good one💙,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after 10 daysFirst of all im just loving the Oxygen Os ❤️Display :- display is just too good for me.. but there is a pint tint towards the bottom of the screen, with latest 10.5.7 update that issue is 80% solved but with the expense of some brightness shifting. Its actually fine than having that tint issue isn't?😁Performance:- Its just smooth... I doesnt faced any lags,stucks or any app crush its just flowless. But i can see some framedrops when i scroll through some pages. I played PES on this mobile iand it was just a breeze loved playing in the device.Camera:- im not a camera sedric person for me its more than enough good details and nyc colors. But front camera should have been betterBattery:- bettery is ok i would say it gives me 6 hrs SOT with 20 hrs of charge.But it drains very quickly in the overnight 7-8.Initially it takes more than 1 hr 10 min charge but the latest updated cragged up the speed now 0-100% in 55 that is lit😼Overall:- its a good premium midranger that you can look up to...i purchased this instead of RMX2 pro just because i wanted use the device for atleast 3 years. Since that is already an year old phone and  i choose OnePlus and the infamous Oxygen OS ❤️"
518,tarun j,disappointment !!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  there was a tint on screen along camera module which is visible in low brightness, technician admitted that it was a manufacturing defect but amazon refused to give me a replacement, oneplus customer care suggested me to visit service center for a newly purchased device that is worth 30k. if these things happen in budget phones, it's okay but it's a premium midrange smartphone and that too from a reputed brand. checked oneplus forums and saw lots of users are facing same issue, in my suggestion. don't buy this product because amazon is not going to help you with this product after sale. even oneplus is not going to help you with this, the statement i recieved was that is a characterstic of OLED display, while me being using amoled screens from last 4 years, knows that it's not a characterstic feature but a manufacturing defect. not the brand which stands for quality anymore."
519,Sindhuja,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord is a good choice when it comes in to this range of 27999.. one thing I felt is ""please put a full charge and then start using"". I've seen some difference in screen. Initially I didn't liked the screen and I thought of changing it. But it's good in processing."
520,Soumik Halder,Overall the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All total the prpduct is very good with 90hz refreshment rate that makes it more faster and make sure the combination be 8g/128gb or better.. In a glimpse the camera is too good and selfie camera is also very likewise... The superamoled display makes it more attractive and good looking... A premium phone with premium features comes with the brand one plus and as a result the phone comes a good handy in this range of price... I recommemd every self worker or students to make a look at this model
521,PARTHIV MANEPALLI,A Decent Purchase if you are buying a Oneplus for the First time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am using this product for about 10 days now.Pros1) It(Marble Blue) has a very pleasing look and that is one of the major reasons which attracts people to buy this device.2) The User Interface is pretty good. Its really helpful as my previous phone had tons and tons of Bloatware.3) The Fluid Amoled display with 90Hz refresh rate is also quite nice.4) Battery Life : It almost lasts me for about 1.5 days (note: I don't do gaming, but spend more time in netflix, youtube and social media)5) Warp 30T is insanely fast. Charges my phone from 5-100% in about 51 minutes.Cons1) The Camera shoots good quality videos but only in daylight. It screws up in low light or in dark. It blurs the hell out of the surroundings making it undesirable. Same story with photos too. Some great quality during the daytime.2) Still trying to figure out the role of 2MP Macro sensor. I mean there is no reason for its existence. But even when its there, it is not working at all.3) Well, absence of 3.5 mm was anticipated but they could have given a connector in the box. That might have been beneficial for many.for better camera performance, use Gcam to click pictures. And use Stock Cam for videos."
522,Mythlesh,Better than you think,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's nearly been a month with Nord and on my opinion there's been no issues both the fingerprint and face unlock are fast the phone is so smooth even at 60Hz refresh rate and has a really good battery life. Excellent and smooth gaming performances till now screen recording is great and coming to the oxygen os its super user friendly you'll never need an external application or software to feel satisfied cause Oxygen os is one of the best in the market , camera performance is awesome the primary sensor gives much detailed and saturated images then wide angle lens both in front and back camera is the incredible the major blow would be it's macro sensor in my opinion cause the colours are much softer so if you just want to take best pictures you better buy a basic dslr but in overall performance the camera is pretty great, the phone is so slippery without a case so better use it and fast charging really saves you a lot of time, the alert slider is so usefull in short if you are looking for a smartphone in a mid range budget with cool user experience Nord is the best in my opinion but if you expect a high performance machine and ready to make some sacrifices like oxygen os,alert slider etc you have a lot of other options so choose wisely 🤞💕"
523,Kaustav DGupta,"A ""One Week User"" Experience, An Amateur User Experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Without Wasting my words and Your time on Unnecessary Explanation, Let me get to the Points Straight.*765G, A 5G MidRanger Processor is a Decent Processor when it Comes to the Daily doing stuff. It's Reliable & Fast .But, Honestly It's UNNECESSARY, Specially As Per India Market And You Know Why.*Display Produces Punchy colours and Good viewing experience.*Look and In hand feel is really Good.*And Now Finally,for the People who haven't already Experienced OXYGEN OS, to them ""THE BEST THING OnePlus CAN OFFER is the UI of OnePlus"", It's Just Wonderful.And now The Most DEVASTATING Thing about The Most Hyped Phone of 2020 ""The OnePlus Nord"" is It's CAMERA. I mean We Are Paying 28000/30000 INR for a Phone that Has A Pathetic Camera module. It's It's Pathetic. Honestly My Old Xiaomi Note 7S camera Produces more Good Looking Photos. Forget about Specifications, What we are Getting is More Important, I Think.*And They're Some Issues regarding Mobile Data networking and THE HAPTIC VIBRATOR FEEDBACK. Like Some Other OnePlus Devices It Started pinning some Vibrator Issue.Finally, It's NOWHERE NEAR FLAGSHIP KILLER. Just a Decent Phone Which Costs More For It's 5G &""FUTURE READY"" TagLine."
524,Amazon Customer,"""fancy shop, tasteless Chines food"".",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  You will buy this phone only for 1+ brand name and not for performance. I have made a mistake and chosen wrong product. It does,t  meet my expectaion. it's tag line is Never Settle but in this phone they have compromises a lot.It is like ""fancy shop, tasteless Chines food""."
525,Naga Venkatesh,AN USUAL DAILY COMPANION PHONE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a month of using this mobile, it is a clean,neat,fast & smart device which has an excellent display & OS. The main camera is as good as OnePlus 8 , but the other camera's are not at all worth. Battery life is average for an general daily usage. Small network,Bluetooth & display issues. Onething I am satisfied with OnePlus is getting updates constantly that feels me a premium feel. The community of OnePlus & the clean OS of it differ itself from other phones.Final verdict: If you believe in hype then it will not meet your expectations . If you think I need a good daily premium mobile with a good software updates in regular intervals this is the one.PLEASE DON'T BUY WITH HYPE , SEE THE SPECS WHETHER YOUR USAGE MEETS IT."
526,Adithya,Great phone at a decent price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is really good. The blue color is really striking and awesome. Purchased the 12 Gig version and it is buttery smooth, even with a ton of apps running. Display is top notch and the 90 Hertz is super slick. The macro camera is not so useful, but the remaining cameras are super. Battery life is also good and the warp charging pumps it up in no time. Overall, a very good value for money. Would recommend 10/10."
527,Mahin Malhotra,Great option for Casual users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got my device on 4th of Aug after placing a pre order on 28th July/I don't play any heavy end games on my mobile so gaming was never a problem/necessity for me.The display is nice, earlier I wasn't used to the AMOLED display but now I am satisfied with it.The Battery is generally very good and will last easily a day for normal usage.The camera? well I was never a photo enthusiast so I don't can't figure out the biggest down point of the device.I compared it with my brother's Samsung A50 and observed the Nord has a bit more accurate colors atleast for me.The only issue I found was the tint issue but that too is observed under very rare circumstances and probably will be fixed in a future OTA.TL;DR :- If camera and gaming aren't your priority and you need a good phone with a very clean OS then go for it."
528,Sumit Nandy,Go for it : Post reading the review :P,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone at this price point. I have been using for last 10 days.Pros:Good camera - provided some samples hereCrystal clear AMOLED display. There is no Green Tint issue, at least with my phone.765g processor enables the gaming and overall phone experience to be seamless. There is no lag while gaming.ConsBattery optimization could have been better. I have been using op5 which has 3800mah and it provides better battery optimization. Battery on Nord lasts approx a day on normal usage and burns in 13-14 hours with heavy gaming and videos.Missing audio jack, though the phone provides hd sound output on Bluetooth headphones.Overall pretty good phone provides top of the line performance at decent price range. One plus oxygen ui makes the experience hassle free and amazing. Should definitely go for it."
529,Aswin Hari,Best phone for normal use under 30k,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is best for users who want a phone for normal usage and maximum lasting.Pros are 5G capable which makes future proof, good gaming experience, oxygen os UI, 30 watt charger, best in display fingerprint scanner as there is no lag, amoled display with 90hz refresh rate, alert slider and bloatware free.Cons are below average camera experience, average battery life, plastic frame, average speaker quality as it not stereo speakers, and dual front camera which makes problem while watching films and games.Final verdict : If you want a future proof phone and is a normal user, it is the best phone under 30k. If you are interested in photography or gaming, please buy phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 series chipset (for gamers) and take iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Note or S series or Google Pixel series (for photography)."
530,Deepak Kumar,Best Camera phone at best price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earlier it was pathetic in term of Night shots,Macro and battery backup.But due to regular updates of Oxygen interface all things are improved,Nightscape shots are even better without grains ,Best part I love is Portrait mode ..it gives more details and colors into image like 85mm dslr lens, Although iam not selfie addict but dual selvie camera is good for Vedio call or online classes even in low light gud Vedio quality in online sessions . But failed at Macro point, even iam not able to use external macro lens because back cameras are near to each other ,will try on selfie camera.later if it works.Wrap charging is awesome almost in less than 30.min full charged..Rest internal features are also unique , Now i have no regret"
531,Vanish,Moderate specs with moderate price .,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   I am having a great experience in using oneplus nord as my primary device. I have attached few of the camera samples you can check them out to get the accurate idea about the quality it delivers. Talking about battery life, i agree that its not that good but after the update power consumption is improved to a great extent and the result is visible as well ( u can have a look on the ss attached ..)Battery life - 9 hours of screen on time  with moderate usage ( including asphalt 9 ,youtube Instagram , and normal day to day surfing )Coming to build quality yes it does have plastic frame but i can assure you of the premium feel while holding it but still you have to put it in the cover almost all the time to ensure safety.Conclusion - Each and everything is moderate about nord including the price."
532,Nitika Nair,A good daily phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered the phone on 20th and received the same on 24th, the product was perfectly sealed, Used the phone or 24 hours now and the review for the phone is as followspros:1. Good battery life: Charged the phone yesterday night and until 11 am today the phone is still at 60%, overall happy with the battery life2. Full-screen display: the 6.4"" display gives you amazing viewing experience.3.Rear camera: The rare camera does an absolutely fantastic job both in daylight and at night. I was actually mesmerized by the nightscape mode, though it feels that the photo was captured in daylight it does an amazing job.4. fingerprint sensor and face lock is quite apt and fast5. Tint issue: I didn't find any tint issue on my phoneCons:The only drawback for me is the front camera but I guess oneplus will resolve the problem. The problem is after zooming, the pictures appear to be grainy, if you are viewing it on a normal mode you won't see the issue, it is only seen if you zoom in.That's the only problem I haveOverall the phone is worth every penny and I'm happy to have it"
533,Vishnu,A SMART PICK FOR A MIDDLE CLASS ONE PLUS FAN,4.0 out of 5 stars,  first of all I would like to give spoiler alert:It's not a perfect midrange phonecons:not a beastnot so fast(but suits for daily usage)battery stand by is above meanpros:execellnt UIgood ram managementvibrant displayhandy and compactExperience:basically I bought this device on a sole purpose to experience one plus feel.clean and stock ui grabbed my attention (as its the most legible os skin in android) .I had an issue with unlocking . finger print is decent but face unlock fails to work some times (not every one experiences it.. cause mine is a low lit area)as nord supports 5G it's a future proof phone but not truly(cause we are uncertain of 5G arrival-buying this for mere 5G is like waiting for a ship at an airport)I like the while packing case cause its a premium fell to open😂NORD can compete with other competitors like realmex3 pro/Samsung M51PS:IF U ARE NEW TO THE WORLD OF ONEPLUS (as they say so) This will start your journey with them smoothlyplot twist: THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW
534,Amazon Customer,Check charging/usb port of Nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I normally don't give -ve reviews but had bad experience with Nord. On delivered day I applied for return/replace the product bcz it was not charging at all and micro usb port got disabled on its own. This could be issue with software or hardware but didn't expect from one plus. Thankfully Amazon troubleshooting app detected it and I could returned the product. Please try charging phone first before login into Google.I have not experienced this kind of issue with phones I have used like motorolla,samsung,redme,lenovo.Hope others wouldn't be getting such issues and if you experienced something like it after replacement policy is over then I think phone needs to be given in one plus service centre and it would be headache for us."
535,Koushik P,A classic midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using Nord since 5 days. Seems to be pretty much good.Pros :Display - Amoled display with refresh rate of 90Hz makes the display very smooth.OS - The oxygen OS is by far the best user friendly OS.Battery Life - Battery life is pretty descent. With refresh rate set to 60 Hz and normal use, (Social media apps and camera) the battery lasts for 8 - 9 hours (Screen usage time).Warp Charge - Charges from 0-100 in 52 minutes and 15-100 in 46-48 minutes.Processor - Phone doesn't lag a bit (No heavy gaming) Snapdragon 765g is powerful.Camera - Videography seems to be good.Cons :Camera - Out of the 4 camera(rear) only the main camera and Wide angle camera are good. Macro and the other camera are below average. Images are blurry with macro mode. If you're enough patient, click photos with pro mode.Design - The plastic body of the Nord makes this less safe and less durable.Finger print reader - In display finger print reader works on optical sensor which not fast.Pretty much more than the budget mid rangers also a little less than the flagships."
536,Illayaraja,All rounder in mid range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All rounderAll Good expect Macro and depth sensor, however main 48 camera sensor and front 32 sensor both are great and wide angle is okiesh.OnePlus Default dialer and messaging apps are missing which is disappointing."
537,Amazon Customer,Automatic call recording is missing,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing mobile but very disappointing thing is automatic call recording is missing
538,vikas b,"No really, settle for the Nord!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A lot of thought has gone into every single component of the phone and it's evident while using it. The phone is buttery smooth and feels rather premium. This goes to show that that specs don't matter as much if you focus on delivering a killer user experience. That being said, my device has a touch of green tint when the background is grey but it's nothing major and it's only there of you are looking for it."
539,Maddy,Batter drains quickly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is much hype about the product but not upto the mark.1. Battery drains very quickly2. feels heavy than my previous mobile (Oppo real me, sorry for comparing but its true)3. Hanging frequently4. dial pad is very short even though the screen is 6+ inches5. Setting up and naming alarm is not available6. Thumb unlock is not as good as its mentioned7. The charger adopter looking like a stabilizer (heavy and big)8. There are other defects too, i will keep addingBut one plus should pay me for the defects i observed and making the product next version better. ;)"
540,Shivanand,Good phone. Selfie cam could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazon delivered the product before the promised date. Packaging was good and exchange of my old phone took place without any hassle. Coming to NORD, it came with preinstalled apps such a as amazon, prime, Netflix and so on. Front cam could have been better as it’s not showing up true colors and contrast after the pic is clicked. 2 np Macro lens behind is useless. Amoled screen is very very good and sharp images and videos are displayed when you have a high speed broadband. Although I’m against Chinese brands, I did not have choice in the budget I had and Nord sort of checked all the boxes for me. Any non-Chinese brand coming up with good specs in limited budget then am all go for it. Until then will use Nord. Overall rating: 4 of 5"
541,Ashish R.,Missing some basic features,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well missing basic features of parallel app, no dual Sim, missing call recording although some video claim but unable to see sweeping left right. Phone is also bulky, using 5T for a long time and not impressed with it. It may be a good one for new phone users but a clear cut in features of a good premium phone. I am trying to return the phone but Amazon arrange a technician to visit to check missing dual Sim, parallel app and recording features. A clear no go from my side. Yes may be good for a first time buyer"
542,Supriya,Dont expect more,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First i have many expectations on nord,may be  because of those expectations i am not so satisfied with the product.but for this price u can try other mobiles. I couldn't listen my phone ring if i am little far away from it.but when I play songs in it,the sound quality is good enough.as the ram is 12 gb its fast enough.when its about cam quality not as good as flagship phones. The micro lens is  not at all good as its just 2mp.Those who want to own oneplus but have less budget can go with this but have to sacrifice some considerations like camera quality...,ring quality.This review was written after using it for one month. The battery life is awesome after its fully charged it can be used continuously for 6 to 7 hours..and it also take very less to time charge as its a warp charging.27% charged in 10 mins nearly(23 to 50)"
543,Saurabh,Overall phone is good except battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall the phone is good. I think there is some battery issue... battery drains rapidly... after full charge it last for only 15 hr with normal usuage.I not even play high graphics game like pubg, call of duty etc if I do so then how long battery last I doubt."
544,arjun chawla,Honest Review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was using oneplus6, thought it would be an upgrade with not much investment. On the contrary i felt i've downgraded. Otherwise a good phone for first time oneplus users who r planning spend 25-30k. Very poor camera, either oneplus is cheating by saying its the same camera from oneplus8 or oneplus 8's camera is very poor. Did'nt feel quality and sturdiness. My initial plan was to sell my oneplus 6, but i ended up selling the new nord, You can imagine the resentment i had after buying oneplus NORD.....I recommend oneplus users not buy NORD, INSTEAD go for oneplus 8/7/7T."
545,Nirmal,Review after 2 days usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was looking for a budget phone under 30k after analysing some of the model finally I ordered OnePlus Nord  Amazon delivery was amazing delivered the product one day beforePros1. Good display really enjoying 90hrz refresh rate it's make a good feel when you watch Netflix hd movies2. Main features I loved most is OnePlus UI it's very clean and crisp compares other Android phone UIs ( Samsung and other Chinese phones)3. Processing is pretty decent not felt any lag or freezing issue ( not a gamer mostly uses office applications and social media and online streaming apps)4. Built quantity is very good you can feel it when you hold the phone , very good weight balance as per the size of the screen5. No heating issue while long duration calls and online meeting sCos1. OnePlus is Chinese company.  as I said I was looking for below 30k phone and I don't find any better suit in the market I have tried Samsung m30s and a51 in couple of weeks but both phone has lot of issue including software bugs and heating issue"
546,Arun Manikandan,Nord is a good phone but,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  No product is perfect and the same applies to this phoneColour shifiting in display is very prominent and annoying when viewing content in white backgroundLoud speaker is loud but lacks clarity and punchFingerprint sensor is unreliable sometimesCamera is good but not the bestVibration motor is lacking qualityEverything other than these are goodGood smooth display, software, reliable performance, Good one day battery life for an average user etc."

548,Ash omkar YT,"""Heavy"" phone with perfect balancing of weight",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. An coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed...."
549,Shridhar,Average Performance with high Price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Costly as per Indian market as oneplus charging 5k extra for their brand name .My bottomline is price if you are oneplus lover than go for it . Most of review by certified buyer's are almost true about camera , performance and battery are average and 5 G is Future till than there will be lot of coming in Indian market.6G 199998GB  2299912GB 24999"
550,Rahul Kumar,Okayish phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Nothing outstanding for the price. Okayish phone for a slightly steep price.Feels a bit heavy in the hand. In screen fingerprint reader not a good as a physical one. Awkward aspect ratio. Slightly on the taller side doesn't make for a good viewing experience. Can skip this one.

553,manish bisen,Good budget phone 👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Reviewing after 2 days. It's good budget phone. But better than MI Realme Samsung.Might be they brands can give you more features in this range. But we all know all brands mobile performance slow after 1 year.But it's one plus brand it runs smoothly even after 2 year.Now pointing on this Nord -Back cemera is good but front cemera could be more better.Battery is pretty good not too. Because 90HZ phone so battery drain sure will.If you customize your mobile in 60 HZ so ur battery gives more life.Speaker so good.Bluetooth connectivity amazing.Ram adjustment nicely.Handy phone, smart access. Look premium.Overall I'll give 4 star.Main things that phone customization is too good.Best for multitasking.No heating issue.One thing I'll clear now. Whenever u buy new phone and then do on that phone. Every phone will heat first time or 1 days at least because their parts are start now to run. So don't tremble for heating issue."
554,Deepak Chauhan,Premium Feeling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing a review after using this OnePlus Nord for 5 days high usage.First of all it's look like premium mobile (ignore frame as most of users will use protective case). In normal usage it gives about 1.5 day battery usage and in high usage it gives approx 1 day battery backup. I didn't notice any issue regarding display even in very low and high brightness as many of users reported.Pros.1. Battery backup is awesome2. Looks premium3. Smooth display4. Camera is good5. No bloatwares & ads6. No stereo speaker but speaker is loud and clear7. Good video viewing experienceCons.1. Very fews apps are supported in Parallel Apps2. Camera is struggling in low light3. Depth sensor and macro sensor cameras are worst. No meaning of this sensor and I don't know why they add this camera, just for quad camera setup.I will update this review after using this device for few more days and sure update soon if I notice any issue."

556,mohammed rafi,Display issue in just 3 weeks and Worst Online Support,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display Issue: The phone (Nord, 12 GB / 256 GB) was working fine till 3 weeks, yesterday suddenly one white line appeared in the center of the phone and heated up.  After reboot the phone screen is now red in colour and phone heat is very high. I saw several screen issues for the Nord phone. So please check before you buy.Support Issue: When I tried to contact the support number (4 times I tried) which was not attending even after waiting for 15+mins, no reply from support mail box and after waiting 20 mins in support chat I could talk to a executive and he told me to visit nearest service center which is 80km far from here. Online support is very worst and support centers are less. If you are not in a metro town / city, please check the service center availability before you buy the phone."
557,Shan,"Very disappointed with delete very , Product is ok",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very disappointed with delivery , I placed pre order on 28th July & received the package after 15 days , very poor delivery experience People who ordered on 06th August that too with 10% discount in price has recently v d product in 3 days,  When contacted Amazon clarifies that shipment is based on delivery date & not order date .This is a major flaw in their systemProduct : it's an average product don't expect too much as it was hyped , Display is ok & watching movies want that great , refresh rate is ok , camera quality is not bad but it would have been better , for 28k it's overly priced accept 5G spec , it's in par with 15k Realme XT"
558,Souteyo B.,Preety Good if you are a normal user...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I order the device in Amazon around 6th of August and got the Device on 19th August..Till date I have received 2 ota updates 1 during the day I have unbox and the last one few days back...CAMERA: The camera of this device Is far better than my previous device,Captures decent photographs through primary camera and Depth camera I think is of no use because I have tried clicking photos multiple times covering the depth sensor of the device but that didn't help..The primary camera gets the work done relating to portrait images.. I don't understand why they gave the quad camera set up.. Macro camera performance is below average according to 28k phoneDisplay: Very smooth in 90HZ refresh rateBattery:improved after the update I got few days backPerformance:It is great according to me no lag(well I don't play Pub-g)Well a very decent device according to the need..If the update fixes issue of the camera it will be very helpful"
559,priti priyam,Very poor quality phone. It started hanging and apps get crashed. Not suggested at all.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just after 2-3 days it started hanging and most of the app gets crashed and phone gets rebooted automatically.  Battery back up is also very poor. when i contacted the customer care of oneplus, they sent some setups but it did not work.  Then they suggested to contact service center.  I contacted service center they told that its a software problem and they reinstalled teh software.  But even after that the same problem persists.I mailed to oneplus for the replacement on which they said to contact amazon.  But in amazon it shows that return period is over.  So this is the punishment i am getting for trusting oneplus brand and after spending 30000 I am being tortured and feeling cheated.  I would once again request oneplus and amazon to replace my phone with new one or refund my money."
560,Kumar,In par with budget with minute backlogs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.Finger print reader and face recognition is on mark! Work ultimately and can assure that none of the phones with similar budget can't provide with same work2. Battery life is kind of average. However it can be compensated by fast warp charger which can charge within half an hr. It better to carry a charger when you travel.3. Camera quality is also kind of average. Comparatively I feel one plus 6 camera works well.4. Phone touch and performance are class like all one plus phones give.Totally, A person who needs phone casually can buy this( a good option). Its not recommendatory for those who uses phone continually with little pauses and who is kind of phone photographers."
561,Riyaz,INTERNET DATA CINNECTIVITY ISSUE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Please search for mobile issue in google before you buy,  there has been a ton of connectivity issues from many nord users including mine. AND NONE OF SO CALLED AUTHENTIC TECH REVEIWERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS IS INTO GENERAL PEOPLES ATTENTION.I am not recieving 4g internet speed on oneplus,  this is network coverage issue as i hv been using same sim on lg g6 which gave a super high speeed 4g connection.On top of it,  unable to connect to games like free fire,  it ahow network connection error,  but i switch to wifi,  it connects seamlessly.I am planning to return the device,  i am waiting hear back from oneplus."
562,Ramesh Gupta,Phone is continuously getting hanged,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Guys, be careful with the low end phone of OnePlus.  It is keep on getting hanged.  Network getting disconnected while talking.  Wifi is not detecting many a times.I used oneplus 3t for 3 years.  Decided to upgrade with this model, but turned to be a great downgrade.  I posted in OnePlus forums.  No response.  Be cautious!Poor performance from Service center.  I have raised the complaint again."
563,belal,cons. and pros.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  after a week of use here are some pros ans cons,cons1. no 3.5 mm jack2. sound quality is above average nt the best in range3. rear and selfie camera is quite good bt at this price range we have better option (about image quality).pros.1. video quality is awsm2. battry life is good, and can charge 20-100% in less than 40 min( charging speed mast hai)3. 765G works best, no lagging .4.screen is the best part u will notice, i mean very fluid type its jst feel like its flowing at 90htz.5. above all its very handy and looks very luxurious.6. noise cancellation tagda hai, mic is also goodin my view its one of the best phone under 30k . go for it,hype bahut tha bt aisa b nahi ki hype galat tha, go for it.😁👍"
564,Vishal Gajavelly,Overall it's a good purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I am satisfied with the product.The performance is amazing so is battery life. Gaming is decent. The Backside glass material is very attractive and gives you a premium feel.Here come a few minor cuts they have made, the camera is an average especially micro cam, if you compare with the recently released pixel which is of similar price rate. The display is good but not the 'The Best'. The frame material of the mobile is plastic, so be a little careful if you wanna use it without a case. These are minor issues. For a normal user, majority don't notice.But if you are a frequent or a passionate photographer, I think you would be a lit bit disappointed. Or if you a hardcore gamer, I think there are better mobiles in the market.But I can assure you that it balances all the features you want to find in today's smartphone. If you are buying in 2020 it is 'The best' overall purchase in its price range."
565,Shefali Jain,"Very cheap quality phone, Camera seems like VGA",1.0 out of 5 stars,  After using this phone I realized that my previous phone which I bought 3 years back is much better.  2 major concerns that I found were an extremely bad camera and screen. My regular phone which has a 60hz refresh rate has a much much better display. Seems like OnePlus used some very cheap quality products and got this out so that people realize that OnePlus 8 is really worth it.
566,Parboti D.,"FLAGSHIP CAM OF ONEPLUS 8,60HZ IS ALSO SMOOTH",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am giving my honest review after 1 week1)The camera is super awesome far far best from my expectations,at first i was also confused whether the camera wiill be good or not...but trust me the selfie and rear camera are performing as oneplus 8 (as my freind also use OnePlus 8 so i have compared)2.even when i use the phone in 60Hz it feels like i am using in 90 hz its too smooth in 60hz to  No doubt the phone is super awesome idk why people are giving bad review3.THERE IS NO GREEN TINT ISSUE AT ALL"
567,RAJADURAI,Nice Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice Product.Review After using 8 Days.Pros:* Amoled Display is awesome.* Fingerprint Reader works super fast.* Battery Life is very good. Normal usage it can use upto 1.5 Days.* Camara Quality good both front and Back.( Portrait, Normal Photo, Nightscape, PRO mode) Update immediately received for Camara Quality Improvement.* PUBG/COD No lagging upto HD.* If u r a Gamer Use fnatic mode for better gaming performance.* Phone Looks Premium.* Call Quality is good.Cons:* PUBG/COD light heating while played in HD.* Auto Call recording option not available.* Contact Search Option need improve.Oveall Good Phone in this price and Segment 12GB RAM and 256GB Memory."
568,Amrathesh,Worst camera.. Update or return money..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  *Very disappointed with camera, macro camera not working properly. Front camera gives more bright pic which looks high contrast.*Videography is excellent with same camera......*Waiting for camera updates from oneplus community....."
569,Tushar Meshram,Worth to buy but I got damage piece,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall specification worth to the price as compare to same budget mobiles.. No issues with mobile camera is good and display is working smooth.. but facing network issue..  after every 5-6 hours network automatically gone.. every time need to put sim into sim tray.
570,Sailaja,Premium at price point! Worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using it for about 3days, i didnot face any battery draining issues, but i came accross green and purple tint when I use it on night mode,but it's not a big deal for me bcz I don't use dark mode much! Coming to gaming I played pubg it ran fine and there is no heating issues while gaming!Cameras are good but still have to be the best as they mentioned!Display is gorgeous and looks premium while holding it on hands(Plastic frame u may not notice that)Coming to oxygen os is the best Ui I had ever used, it is smooth, snappy and well optimized! Oxygen os coupled with 8Gb of ram and that 90hz amoled panel makes the device fast and smooth... Overall for daily drivers it is the best device at that price!"
571,Siddhant Sharma,Premium for Everyone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Nord disappointed me at the beggining, but with every update the phone started showing its true potential. With a decent battery life, which is not a problem because of the Dash Charge the phone works fine throughout the day. The main camera is the USP of this device, which works perfectly fine for me, (have a attached a few images testing the various features of the camera) the remaining cameras are also showing improvement with each update, but it may take some time to be as perfect as the main 48MP camera taken from the OnePlus 8. Overall the phone is near to perfect at this price point and the 12GB RAM + 256GB space is definitely a banger packed in a beautifully crafted phone."
572,Anoop Kaur,Worth the money 💰 but not without it's flaws.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall the build and form factor feels good in hand. love the one plus' minimal UI. It's super fast and fluid, no bloatware whatsoever.The camera is sorta decent, not too good but not half bad either (see the attached photo for example)Battery life is a little bit disappointig. it charges extremely quickly but doesn't last a whole day.90Hz display is definitely one of it's best features that you gotta try.Overall it's a good looking phone with tons of great features and a couple of it's things that being it down.If you can overlook the battery life and you are not a pro at photography then you should definitely go for this."
573,Alan,A well rounded phone for the budget.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall its a good product with little tweaks here and there.Very much sufficient and smooth for normal usage.For camera, the main 48 MP sensor is good. I was able to get some good quality pictures in good lighting. The front camera is also really good.An unnecessary 2MP macro camera.Face Unlock is quick, but the Fingerprint reader is a bit slow.During the first usage after unboxing, the phone heated up pretty significantly, but the problem subsided during succesive uses and now its runs with a minimum heating.Battery life is good enough to get you through a 9-10 hr screen time ( not gaming) and the 30W warp charger delivers as promised.At low brightness in dark background there is a purple tint on the bottom part of the display. But its not that bad, and is not visible while watching videos or other media content."
574,Afnas Aboobacker,MY DREAM COME TRUE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I always dreamed about owning a one plus device and one plus had my dream come true.Took a long time time to get my phone but it was worth the wait.Had no tint issue or any other complaints,I think they have fixed these issues in the coming phones.90 hz refresh is so smooth,camera quality is great except for the macro camera but no big deal.Have some improvements to me made in the camera department and one plus is working on it.Gaming was smooth and one plus has guaranteed a higher settings in pubg in their future updats.Amalod screen is great.Got two updates.Battery back up has improved,also improved night shots of front camera.Oxegen OS is the best part no ads and smooth experience with good customisations and features.I know it's frame is made out of plastic but doesn't feel cheap.Will be updating more details regarding this phone.Its a balance phone.Perfect for all use🥰🥰🥰.By the way thank you Amazon and One plus"

576,Delta,Tint issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Tint issue is there. Tint issue is specifically on gey and black color and is noticeable on every brightness level. Disappointed from OnePlus display issue.
577,Rehan Akhtar,"Battery life, user experience, camera, Gcam, tint issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good phone. Nothing unique, above average battery life, decent user experience and good display. The tint can be noticed when something dark grey appears, like a blank chrome page. When something absolutely black appears, no tint issue can be noticed. The camera is good, primary, wide and front. Pictures are colour accurate and detailed but sometimes turn out  to be a bit over exposed and white balance is inconsistent. I tried using Gcam, it produced a better results comparatively. But the OnePlus camera at its own is still good. The fingerprint reader is fast enough and face ID too. You will need to unlocks some features for more smoother experience. I will definitely recommend this phone for content consumption, camera and casual gaming."
578,Tony Mathew Abraham ,Not your ordinary OnePlus device - for a good reason,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got the device today in the afternoon - it's been a beast so far :D.Fingerprint reader works fine, and I'm yet to completely test the battery life. The 90Hz AMOLED display is a sweet addition to this device for this price point.The Onyx Gray looks and feels premium, atleast for the sub-30k price point. And the 12GB of RAM nakes the phone blazing fast, atleast fresh out of the box.The packaging beats the likes of premium OnePlus devices, and the mix of Black and Teal is a welcome combination.So far, it's been a good experience with this device."
579,Jabir P,My personal review after 2 week usage of nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For me its a budget friendly phone..I think it is the king of mid ranger phone... That is I used many mid ranged phone .. but I didn't got this much performance.The camera quality is above average and battery life is perfect for movie lover, normal use like calling, wsp, insta, etcFingerprint reader is so fast and awesomeIn my opinion if you have 30k rs you should look for the high variant of 12GB/256GB RAM and internal storage respectively.. Also didn't face any tint issue or bluetooth, wifi issues that are just gimmicks.. Just go buy yaar you will love it.."
580,Vineeth kumar,Descent mobile - should have been better!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display1. Good amoled display with 90hz refresh rate,but not the best in this price segmentCamera1. good shots with the primary camera in all lighting conditions2. Descent wide angle shots, most of the times images are pretty soft3. Primary 32mp selfie camera is average, overexposes the image, ultrawide camera is useful4. No need to mention the remaining two cameras, straight up trashCharging is speed is very good, full charge around 1hrBattery lasts more than a day with 90hz mode765g Processor is good enough, multitasking is a breeze, don't know how it works with gamingBig thumbs up for oxygen OS, clean software experience"
581,Sonali Gandhi,Worth a buy!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the product in 4 days.The product got so much hype that I was forced to buy this. Especially this blue marble colour with glass at the back is so mesmerizing.Good battery life, i just charge it once in a day and it goes on with moderate usage.30W charging just makes it charge 70% in 35 minutes approx.Camera quality is awesome but micro camera and depth sensor is just a waste. They could have applied that cost in making ultrawide better but after considering all the facts, the phone is worth a buy for this cost you are getting a good brand good battery life, 48mp main camera which makes your experience better, especially 5g support and chipset does not make you feel behind any flagship model. Also it shows a very good quality in nightscape mode.So its a buy rating from my end but I am giving 4 stars bcz of micro camera."
582,Priya Mishra,FACTORY RESET HAPPENED AUTOMATICALLY,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing this review after using it for about a month..The phone was working well until today when it started to do a factory reset ON ITS OWN..I have read a feedback of one customer complaining the same issue..ONE PLUS PLEASE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE..camera is good..finger sensor is working properly...overall phone is good..if one plus team resolves this issue then it would a great phone to use for couple of years...
583,Amazon Customer,"Bad camera quality, don't fall for brand names",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very much excited to get this product, but I'm feeling bad for choosing this mobile as it has more cons than pro's.Camera quality is very bad, the first thing I did after switching on the phone was to click a picture and was very much disappointed with the image captured. A cheaper phone would take nicer pictures. Also the image saving takes a second or so gap, so finding it difficult to capture moving objectsApps are hanging a lot while using multiple applications at same time. Screen is getting frozen for few seconds (15-20) and as a fast hand person I feel very much frustrated.Not a mobile expected from one plus. I fell for the brand name, and it's a life time lesson.I don't recommend this mobile if you expect good speed and good camera quality. Other than these features I didn't expect anything else from one plus brand."
584,Siva R,Stop letting us use gcam 🤦🏻‍♂️,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I trusted oneplus for future updates for camera hence i haven't returned the nord mobile. They provided the update but whats the use. Iam expecting atleast oneplus 5t camera quality in this nord. Please don't let us use gcam mod, we all buying your mobile mainly for stock camera.Expecting future camera updates or else i will broke my nord to make video because of camera disappointment."

586,Pratham K.,Love the oxygen os.... The best thing in the phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks super premium in hand, This phone is good for the people who aren't heavy gamers, 0 bloatwares, 90hz refresh rate amoled display is super smooth. Brightness is really good, camera image processing is little late can be fix through updates, oxygen os is the best thing in OnePlus phones one can get, charging speed is super fast can fully charge phone in less than 1 & half hour. Overall it's awsum...."
587,Animesh ,Pretty impressive,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus Nord is really an impressive phone with a relly good price.The camera is amazingThe only thing that lags this phone is the battery life which is quite fine but could have been a lot better.Fingerprint scanner is Okay.You really can say that -This phone is everything you could ask for at a really good price.
588,S Senthilkumar,"Shorter battery, longer heat issue for short usage",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst battery life, it is not even withstanding a day thogh only used for minimal usage, never gone for gaming, video streaming still battery drains drastically, I need a replacement.Another big drawback is heating issue, heating for normal 3seconds call, I have never faced this issue in my earlier phones ...verybad experience with nord... Disappointed, lot of hypes in the phone, it is normal another phone with 5g technology(don't know about 5G compatibility only we know when started using 5G, they sold and earned profilt)Only camera quality is good.."

590,satish kumar,Average Camera and low battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Updating my review after 45days of usage.Pros:1) Awesome look and feel2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate3) Sound quality is good4) Premium design5) Fast on screen Fingerprint scanner6) Quick charging7) No heating issuesCons:1) Average camera -- not expected at this price range (28K)2) No support to headphones Jack (now a days everyone is using bluetooth devices so its not a big issue)3) No led notification light4) Battery backup is low (Highly not recommended for gamers)
591,Rakshitha,Best phone by OnePlus in midrange,5.0 out of 5 stars,  * Battery : Initial days the battery was draining really fast but with continuous updates from OnePlus my battery lasts for atleast a day* Camera : About the camera I see many comments stating that the quality is not good but In my opinion due to the updates given by OnePlus the camera quality has improved and it's best* Finger print sensor is fast* There no display issues like tint*Best ram managementConclusion:  OnePlus has done 283 optimization and it is continuing to do the optimization so in my opinion oneplus has the best service and they listen to their customers every time !Overall it's a best phone
592,Shubham Magidwar,The Best all in one Product💙,5.0 out of 5 stars,  So I have bought this phone straight after my one plus 6 experience. This is the phone which I was looking to buy. Firstly I loved the color as it looks preety cool(my fav as well). Talking about the phone I am really loving it each & every day. No doubt about the quality & also the storage is Good. Camera quality is great with a different level of experience. If you are looking for the best phone with a satisfying price you must go for ONEPLUS NORD ! 💙
593,Vaibhav Wardole,Everything is average and Surely not value for money,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There's nothing's great as such.First of all I had to Wait for almost 25 days to get it😑 So first they hiked your curiosity so that you would feel like it'll be such a great phone but intact I was pretty disappointed with it. Camera is averageAnd it heats up so quickly. Battery is not enough , drains out very quickly.I just unboxed it , it was at 48 and just after 10 mins without even playing any high end content or gaming, only few clicks and lil bit browsing the juice went down to 35 , seriously.Not sure it's because of that 90 Hz refresh rate which I didn't feel anything different.Overall I would say does not meet expectations and not worth to wait for months to get it."
594,Deepak Chauhan,Try your luck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is decent but the price is a bit more looking at the specifications they provide on paper vs the actual performance you get.I replaced my Nord in 2 days as the display apart from showing green and pink tint even on brightness above 50 percent exhibits a dark purple patch that was affecting my daily day to day usage.You'll be lucky if your unit is not plagued by such display issues.Cameras are not even average they lack focus and clarity even in full lighting, but that can be improved via Software updates.But tinting issue can't be fixed with a software update."
595,Swami,Excellent Performance...765..SD and Fluid Amoled Display,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome mobile in this mid range segment..Excellent display..wonderful camera..sleek and light weight design..Overall a quality product from OnePlus..Actually I don't like very big screen mobiles..Since it's a 6.44 inch..light weight..compact design...Five stars to OnePlus Nord
596,Saptak  Kulkarni,Overall a good package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my delivery on 26th...so have been testing is for 4 days now...and it works absolutely fine...I didn't find any problems...(those having display tint issue they will be fixing it in next update)Camera I would rate it 4 out of 5...macro is ok and overall camera is good...with some upcoming updates it should be good EnoughPerformance wise is quick damn quick...i play PUBG a lot it there not delay at all...and the extreme setting is soon gonna come...I didn't face any issues while calling, connecting bluetooth headphone it works absolutely fineBattery is also good idk why people are saying bad battery performance but it's more than enough...and Charing it also pretty fastAnd this phone is quite handy not too big or heavy..."
597,Priyank Deshmukh,Great overall package - Camera could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros : -Great amoled panel with 90hz display.Bloatware free Oxygen OS with 3 years of updates.Sufficient battery. 30t warp charger.No heating issues while long hours of gaming.765g processor for smooth daily usage and gaming.Gorilla glass in front and back which gives it a premium look.Cons:-Dissapointing cameras. May be it can be fixed with further updates.Plastic frame which may lead to durability issue. This can be confirmed only after long usage (more than a year or two).No 3.5 mm jack.
598,Aditya,Best you can get but be patient with Oxygen OS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best value for money. With frequent updates sometimes Oxygen OS becomes buggy such as Google can't connect to internet problem, Google Chrome doesn't load search results, Google Web search and define on a selected word doesn't work properly (shows no internet). These are some issues I faced, which I did not faced other phones having Google."
599,Se,Best phone in this price range!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a bit worried to buy this phone as I had never had a one plus before. My husband has a S10 and I an iPhone XS MAX. I have to say for the price I paid for this the screen is great, the speed is fantastic. The colour is one of the things that I really liked about the phone and I also got the sandstone blue case from one plus which lets me see the blue colour of my phone with some protection. The camera is alright. It hasface and fingerprint scanners. Bluetooth works well. Also it feels very light after my XS Max. Very happy with the purchase.."
600,Deepak,Below Average product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Better option available in this price range.  Very dull screen low speaker volume. An average product not happy at allPlanning to sell this on cashify.
601,Vinayak,Decent Phone for Normal Users. Camera Enthusiast's stay away.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I booked the phone the day it was released and have been using for a week and sharing my experience below,1) Decent phone and good specs. No tint issue was scared on that front2) Camera realistically 4 wasn't required and could have been better3)Battery : As much  as it charges fast it also drains faster.Kind of neutral havent had a chance to go out a whole day or two to test its endurance .4)Used one plus 6T so OS experience nothing much to comment it is really good.5)Simple and powerful processor ,i am a normal user with phone calls ,news and video skimming so the processor and RAM is giving similar experience to that of flagship model.6)"
602,Sandeep Gaur,Don't buy poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have very surprised why people have written good mobile.1. Mobile have heating problem2. Camera quality very poor3. Product not as per discribed4. We are trying to return/replace the item but no one wants to listen my word, it seems that I have to bear Rs.28000/-5. Amazon Customer executives are not responding and till date they have not resolved the issue and also does not want to hear my problem.Overall mobile quality is very poor and I have purchased 1st time oneplus mobile and this is last."
603,V.MADHUSUDHANA,A great phone that is overpriced and wayyy overhyped,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Slightly overpriced for what it offers. Unnecessary depth and macro cams at the back. Great screen and got no tint issues. Mono speaker setup is good but stereo should have been given at this price point. So in a nutshell, a nice phone that is overpriced and wayyy overhyped.PS:One plus marketing team needs to chill and not create unnecessary hype as it can quickly backfire."

607,Sandeep,Camera is worst,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I usually don't write reviews but this I'll as it might help someone. Camera quality is the worst I've seen so far. Color capturing not good, something I didn't expected from giant like OnePlus. Also zoom distorts the image  With this price they should have given us good/average camera. If you want your phone camera to be good then trust me this is not the phone you should buy."

609,Narender kumar,Wastage of money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It drains the battery very fast. It consumes 10-15% battery during your sleeping hours when not in use.During call receiving or calling someone, both the sim cards loses its connectivity. You have to try 4-5 times to call somebody. That's the most irritating thing.Camera is so so . Problem occurs during night or when there is low light.I will prefer not to buy this product."
610,Saleemnurubasha,Great Device for day to day tasks..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Upgraded from realme 1 this is first time owning a Oneplus brand phone.Booked on August 6th during prime day and received on 28th August  .Almost after 10days of usage writing this review .Looks wise amazing no doubt it will give premium feel in hand and it won't feel bulky.I am not Gamer so please don't consider my review if your preference is games. Battery performance is fine with one full charge giving day full of performance watching atleast 2 and half hrs of movie/webseries on prime or Netflix(excellent HD streaming), and not less than 1hr online video conference and some office work.Need little improvement in camera department. Sound quality also descent.Oxygen OS is very smooth and fast.Overall  experience with Nord is great."

Zoom quality is ok.Front camera is bad. Pixels gone busted when you zoom the imagesFacing hardware problems like hanging the apps and stops working. Not good for multitasking.Overall just ok, not as good as described.No automatic call recording option."
612,ashit kumar,Review for one plus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing review after 15 days of use.first thanks to amozon for its quick delivery and that was 3 days before. I found phone very smooth and flawless. Awesome quality camera especially it's macro and it's 10 x zoom. Sound quality suprb. Charging is also very fast , thanks to its wrap charger. Obviously you will be disappointed if you compare it with one plus 7t pro or samsung 20 plus or note 10. But better than I phone 7 or 8 . You don't need to buy cover or screen gaurd as it comes along with mobile."
613,Rahul Dholam,Totally worth the bucks!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my OnePlus Nord yesterday. The very first day I checked my phone was for the green tint issue. The following night when I checked my phone, I see no green-pink tint issue in it. Also the black bar on the top through the punch holes cameras, aren't that visible. Like they get easily hidden away unless you intentionally look for it. Others things like the fingerprint reader and battery life are good and up to mark. About camera quality, I personally would say it as okay. Not impressed very much by camera quality or maybe I need to discover it much further to explore its quality. And the 90hz screen, overall processing and haptics are all good. For me, this phone is near to perfect for which I would give it a 5 star rating."
614,adithya,A trustable mid range phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The oxygen os is very smooth,gaming experience is good so far ,the os is highly customisable.I didn't observe any tint issue so far.Amazon delivery was very good with neat proctective packaging.Totally a nice phone for balanced users like me.Battery lasts for 1day after full chrage I get a screen time of 6hours easily with 90hz referesh rate.No heating issues . Continuous updates are given to fix bugs.Camera captures live colours and you can take insane shots with g cam.Build quality of the phone is pretty normal so put a  full tempered and a case and use it.The only problem that is personally face is no 3.5mm audio  jackCharge speed is super fast as claimed by the company"
615,LeeJay Giri,My experience with Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,   I pre-ordered it and I got and I'm telling my view after good usage..Excellent phone...go for it.. features are really cool... premium experience..all the description given for the phone totally matches with the product..the only issue I've felt was the battery..charge drains a little faster in normal mode but thanks to the fast warp charge it gets charged in a very short time.camera quality is good but the macro was not good enough.. except this overall a good phone and worth the price
616,Sony,Delivered on 15th day after the order,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery: I ordered this product on the 20th of August, and it was supposed to deliver on the 29th of August. But the item was shipped on 28th, and it was delivered on 4th of September. Customer care service provided uncertain information whenever contacted. Waiting for a product for almost half a month is just a waste of time and money.After two days of using, I find the product is reliable.Camera is too good.Battery does not hold the charge even for a day.Charging speed is slower than my moto turbo."
617,Heera,Good phone but could have been better!,4.0 out of 5 stars,   Over all it's a decent phone for this price. Great for someone who is looking forward to buy one plus. Oxygen OS is super smooth. One thing I really like is the filters in camera. They are doing a great job.Here are the cons I noticed:1. Front camera smoothens out everything. Images not that sharp.2. Whenever I search something on Google it shows offline though signal is quite good. If I redo the search twice or thrice it then gives the result.3. Face unlock doesn't work properly in dim light.4. Only 2 system provided font styles. One plus could have included few more fonts atleast.Apart from these down points the phone is a snatch.
618,Mohammad Ahmad,Average Phone for Average User,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is an average phone. With everything second best, screen is 90 Hz and is smooth but colours aren’t  so Punchy.Camera is also average, front camera softs and ruins pictures by AI, could be fixed by software let’s see.My variant has 12 Gb of ram but works like it has less.Conclusion- Its really nice phone for average user but i will not recommend it for someone who is looking forward it for photography, or some serious usage."
619,Shubham Pardeshi,Below 30k 👌,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  In this price really good phone one plus launched. Buy One plus NORD if you are going to buy a new phone. I purchased this cause i wanna take online lectures for hours and tried its camera and other features, initially liked it."
620,Amazon Customer,A classy product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A product which is excellent for the price it is at. Amother class creation from the 1 + stable ! Totally money's worth. Features are brilliant. However was left a bit disappointed when I discovered, it's only 1 sim phone and for head sets / earphones one has to order the earphones cable as the port has not been given. Overall the phone is really good."
621,Frederick Kostka,Seems like I Settled with the Nord. Disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  So disappointed with the Nord. After all the hype created by One plus, I feel like my basic Asus Zenphone from years ago is still better.I've had the phone for 3 days and already facing significant issues.The phone heats up significantly during minimal usage. And now even when idle.Lags while switching between apps (So much for 12GB RAM!)Screen freeze so I can't receive callsFront camera quality is averageCan't believe the Nord has such basic problems. Tried connecting with their team but no response. Need a replacement or refund as it's definitely not worth 30k."
622,devesh,Awesome phone and dam good looking in blue color I loved it so much😊😍🥳🥳,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome experience with this phoneOnly 2 things I don't like this phoneOne is front camera in low light is not good & 2nd one is pubg smooth extreme setting didn't get hdr alsoOther than that phone is good and amazing experience you will get and I didn't get any display greentint issueDisplay is awesome and onemore main thing the phone is looking dam beautiful in blue colour I loved it blue colour I think it is the best colour I have ever seen 😊😍🥰
623,varat7v2,Felt like over-priced as compared to others.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like its light-weight and comfortable design; its very easy to use all of its button and screen with single hand. However, looking at the price, I didn't like its camera quality and battery. One plus 6 was better than this though it was just 2-3K higher than this phone. I would say looking at its overall quality, its definitely over-hiked phone. I think we can get phone with equivalent features at 15-18K of another brands. I am very disappointed with its poor camera quality, as I just picked this up - thinking camera would be good compared to others phone."
624,Trushti   patel,Fingerprint and Face unlock is completely worst...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Within 5 days I am facing problem with finger print scanner it's not not working completely, worst fingerprint and face unlock scanner not expected in OnePlus atleast...Even one plus 6 is better than one plus nord which I used previously....Result of camera is not upto the mark.Auto call recording is also not available in this phone"
625,Gurmeet Dhaliwal,Amazing camera phone one plus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really loved the new one plus nord phone .. camera quality is simply amazing .sharing few pictures for reference purposes. Battery life is also too good..very light and simply amazing gadget.  As a content creator ,my focus is always towards a good camera quality nd clear videos. Thank you one plus nord .."
626,prashant joshi,Nice Smooth Experience.....,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Satisfied with this product....Many people will think that there are other better option for this price range in market according to specs....But this Oneplus Nord is a balanced package with the best ui(Oxygen OS) which will give you nice experience.....The Processor 765g is descent in its work...I never got any problem while playing heavy games till now and I know I will not get a problem in future.....If you are a moderate gamer(not heavy gamer) and wanted pretty everything in a phone with OnePlus Branding than go for it.....
627,Akshay Govind,The perfect buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The unit that I received doesn't have the infamous display tint issue and the battery life is also excellent. Now the phone is running OOS 10.5.5 and I get an average of 7 to 8 hrs SOT with basic social media and youtube and not to mention I don't game in this phone and definitely no PUBG. Camera is not the best but sufficient for an average user like me and I believe it will be improved in the coming updates. Build quality is awesome and feels premium for a user upgrading from a below 20k phone. I use Vodadone and VoLTE isn't yet supported by vodafone for this model. It's an excellent choice if you want a premium experience under a budget.
628,Ankit raj,Super👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the biggest reasons to buy the OnePlus Nord is for the software experience. ... Other reasons to go for the OnePlus Nord include an affordable price tag, 5G support, and a great AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The build quality is excellent as well, as is the overall design of the handset."
629,bhuvan,Has Major Heating Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Imagine you’ve just purchased a 27k smartphone, initial days of it, not much screen time, no games installed just google maps, GPS that you use on your way to work and during that the phone heats up so bad that it gives heating alarm everyday within 30 mins of usage! Initially I thought it might be my car’s temperature in the morning hours but even in evening around 8 with just 30-45 mins of gps usage, boom temperature alert! Major Flaw I don’t know how people are keeping with it with higher screen time or maybe just issue with using gps but I had to eventually return it to amazon which was a smooth return and thanks to amazon for that."
630,Smit Modasiya,Good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except camera quality everything is just good, there are quad camera setup but third camera from top to bottom it is never working neither in portrait mode or night mode or wide angle mode or normal camera, it just never used. I think it is kind of gimmick to show that four camera setup. Apart from this the Oxygen os is just awesome as always, battery is mediocre, it runs almost a day for me. I think black onyx is much better color then the blue marble, I purchased bluemarble and it looks nice and funcky but not decent. Onyx Black is much more decent."
631,mansha diggal,This phone is Ok. One,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finger Print reader and face unlock are working very fast.Battery life is good.But Camera Quality made me disappointed. I Never expect that One Plus can give such a cheap quality of camera. When pictures clicked it looks like the mobile picture of 10k or 15k range. Slowmo camera of this phone is not working whenever I tried it it started dimmering. It seems one plus doesn't give much attention on this model and take it for granted. In the beginning I faced many bugs. Suddenly Mobile started to heat and battery was drained quickly, Pixels of picture was torn.Processor and performance of phone is good. But again I'll say worst camera.Lookwise this is good and lightweight."
632,Rajesh,Top in this time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Many review I read and I was in tension.. but after reached my mobile I am very happy.. It's look very premium both front and rear side... camera, sound, display battery backup etc all are best... Only front camera need to improve and I request to  OnePlus company to improve portrait video as a oppo Reno  4...please go for it don't look negative comments ❤️❤️👍👍"
633,Shiva Shankar Panyam,Worst service from Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is a problem with blutooth connectivity, network connectivity and automatically mobile is getting switch off automatically I kept replacement but Amazon response was too worst I never expected such type of response, still they are not giving replacement for the mobile. Please Don't buy electronic products in Amazon ( worst service and response)."
634,Aayushi p.,"Small Budget, Big Packet",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:-Selfie Camera is awesome.RAM & External Memory are beast at this range.Sound Quality is bombardier.Look is too sexy.The back has a beautiful shine and lustrour.Cons:-No earphone jack, so no wired earphones.Back camera is a bit disappointing.Battery life isn't that powerful.All together it's a good into budget phone with a lot of features and a brand name.You can go for it, I promise it won't disappoint you."
635,Govind kendre,One plus nord...♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After using more than week my final review about my one plus nord...♥️This is my honest review about this phoneCamera is decent that means more than avg 8/10Battery - 9/10OS- 10/10Performance -9/10Charging speed -10/10Speaker - very gudIf u want a overall Decent phone under 30 kNote- I'm not gamer that means if u considering for pubg and all heavy games it's not powerful as per other phones competitive phones who have 8 series SoC who did better performance as compared to this.Overall a great phone...if u love gud balanced smart phone with great Os 🔥🔥 and  more than decent performanceYou never regret after purchasing..
636,shankardev,Great hardware for the price; glitch in software. Hope these are taken care of in the update patches,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is a software (app or OS) glitch. The photo gallery just doesn’t open. I have to goto files and look at thumbnail views but cannot blow-up the pictures there either.SMS also has some issues.Even the backlight fluctuates in terms of brightness.Camera seems good, haven’t tried it for low light / nightscape yet. However, not sure how to access the third camera on the back (only have controls to 12 Mp and 48 MP camera)"
637,Avinash,Much needed mid-range entry from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been loyal user of OnePlus from their very first product OnePlus One. Their devices are known for the sheer performances and crisp UI. And this hasn't disappointed either except macro camera.Forget about the negative reviews and take this phone for brilliant experience.
638,chandan kumar,Unable to create the magic this time.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been a one plus one user, and this phone stands nowhere close to it. Be it the design of the phone or the battery life. The processor is pretty good, the phone works very smoothly, and so is the face unlock display and finger sensor unlock. But battery sucks. The camera is not that good but is not that bad also.Overall I will rate this phone 4 stars. I hope that One plus may provide some updates to enhance both the battery life and the camera output. Till then 4 stars."
639,P.N.MURALI,I loved it !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome, phone's really fast, charging is awesome its OnePlus after all, I need not say anything, u can just understand by how fast the stock got finished, durability of the phone is good(many said not soo good but I don't think so), made my life easy, camera got improved after update."
640,Amazon Customer,One plus nord got it after 15th day dead...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  28th July order the phone. Phone got it 25th August but I'm reviewing as on 16th day after.After 15th day  one Plus nord phone is completely dead.Yesterday(15th day) night that one is 85% charge but today morning phone is not working completely dead.So that's ma experience.So please try to another product or brands opted.  that's better...
641,Mohan sriram,Cool to have it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  To be frank the best budget phone that I could get on OnePlus..Seamless and very fast operations..Till a but having issue with the keypad..Camera quality is average..Not very great like other OnePlus and bettery life is good...Overall a budget friendly mobile from Oneplus
642,satish,Best quality with very reasonable price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Im proud holding and using this phone. Superb technology with stylish model.Im sure u love it.Dont go with negative reviews on camera or other quality parameters, pls buy it, u love it. ☺️"
643,Sukruthi,Not happy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Defective piece was delivered. Mobile is getting switched off randomly and after 15-20 mins its getting on. Still waiting for replacement.Finally received very bad customer service from amazon, not at all satisfied. Amzon is not taking the responsibility for the product."
644,Santosh Dash,best for price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The overall phone is great but the camera is not that good and if you are using 90hz then the battery will drain quickly thanks to wrap charge it charges 0 to 100 in 30 min.best part the screen is very good oxygen os is great and fingerprint works fast.avg gaming experience..
645,Pranav kumar,Nord is best,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after 10 days of purchase. This nord works absolutely fine in all conditions. Some of YouTubers said negative for views. Nord display colors r better than any of the IPS display phones n u can play games in HD with NO lags, even though camera also is well optimised (after yesterday's update) . Be FUTURE READY and NEVER SETTLE ❤️OnePlus."
646,Dev11,I'm providing some cons about phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  After one long week usage I found many bugs and many features are not present in this phone for name sake only one pluse here am listing out some cons1. If u use both sims and if u activate internet for sim1 and if u get call to to sim2 internet is disabling not even getting or unable to send normal msgs this is the biggest big. Earlier I was using redmik20pro and there is no this kind of problem2. If u disable whatsapp media visibility and try to download the images from chat it's not downloading.3. No Audio jack4. Network drop outs5. If u enable both fingerprint and face unlock face unlock is not working6. Battery also some what ok.
647,Afinas,Display Issue is REAL,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got my nord delivered yesterday and I have found colour fading at the bottom left corner of my screen mainly at the low brightness(very noticeable).
648,Ipsita sahu,Good phone but not the best as I thought,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Fingerprint reader was good.Battery life was not much good as I've expected.And another thing is the heating issue.The phone heats up while charging and the charger too heats up with the phone.Camera quality was good but the front camera video was not good.It is not having the mirror effect we can't change it on our choice.We can change it on oppo and realme phones but here in OnePlus there's no option available to change.It's default.And the last thing I would tell is that it's not having a SD Card support.It would be better if it would have SD Card Support.Overall I'll give 4 Star to this phone.It's a good phone but it's heating issues are a bit problematic for me.
649,Amazon Customer,Superb 👌,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Superb PhoneOnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000."
650,Apoorv,Green Tint On my Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Facing Green and pink tint on my phone... I know it's not a thing of big concern for many.. But believe me when you notice it once you won't get rid of it. It's hell annoying. After spending 30k (which is huge amount for me) I was not expecting this from OnePlus device.My only suggestion is.. if you can spend 5-6k more...then go for 7t.My feeling for nord is like...""Maza nhi aaya""I finally yesterday asked Amazon to replace the products . Now waiting for Amazon Technician. Fingure crossed"
651,Gipin antony joseph,MY REVIEW AFTER 2 WEEKS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good looking ! Weight is balanced overall everything is good except two major problems, tint issue is not a big deal in Ur daily usage!One major thing is camera:Don't expect much ,it's average, not very good, just good!The other is battery life:Thought would stand at least one day ,but it's hard unless we adjust to keep the charge for the whole day ...I mean not good for a full time user !Updates improved the camera section..but just a slight improvement!Battery is strong after half of of its charged is drainedAnd finger print is just good...!"
652,Gk,Not worth the price and the OnePlus brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone just 15 days ago but very disappointed.The sound quality is very poor , the voice on the call is very lowly heard. 1 GB RAM of apple is way better than 12GB RAM in this phone. The keypad does not pop up sometimes. The new phone battery survives for about 18 hrs on simple phone calls and normal work without any gaming or long videos. If you have couple of zoom calls it dries very fast"
653,RAKESH V,It's an Awesome phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Both the software and the hardware is of high quality. Camera is good and after the updates it's performance has increased and taking good photos and videos. Display is also very good and the processor is also performing without any lags. Battery lasts for 1 full day with heavy usage.
654,Kindle Customer,"Scratches and more scratches, even with gentle usage.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's been less than a month I bought this phone and there are already so many scratches on the phone. The screen is pathetic, it keeps attracting so much dust that I have to keep cleaning every one hour to have a clean screen. I am so disappointed with this phone, no value for money. Also another disadvantage cannot plug in head phones. As it was not enough to spend this amount for this useless phone now I have to spend a heavy amount for the ear buds. And everyone knows how horrible Amazon customer service is, they don't even consider customers as humans after 10 days of return window. For USA return window is 30 days, for India its 10 days. So much racism."
655,Omkar Rahate,"Best for speed & performance, camera is just satisfactory",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  - Great performance in case of multitasking and processing speed.- Overall feel handy and the weight distribution is great.- WRAP charging support works great.Cons:- Observed frequent Bluetooth interruptions while using 1+'s Bluetooth headsets- The DTMF/touchtones while calling is not working properly, whenever called to customer care found the issue that it's not detecting the keys which are pressed.Overall in case of speed and processing Nord is at its best, but if you are looking for a phone with a good camera then this may not be a great purchase for you."
656,Abhisek Thapa,Definitely to go for device.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I had been using a Redmi device for past three years and Nord feels like an amazing upgrade. The 90 Hz screen is a visual treat and the camera quality is good. My battery life is usually 8 to 9 hours as I am a heavy user but 30 W charger is quite fast. I can play games without a hitch and browse Instagram with a lot ease and grace. I really recommend this to all those who can afford it as it is a future proof device.
657,Amazon Customer,Good phone but....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1. Oxygen OS2. Battery life3. Warp ChargeCons:1. Display tint2. Camera below par except the main cameras on both front and backBuy this phone for regular usage and the performance will be as expected from a OnePlus device, smooth. The display does have tinting issues, which might or might not be resolved through OTA updates. The cameras barring the main sensors are below par. The fingerprint reader is quick and recognises almost everytime. The battery can easily last a day under normal usage.Considering Oxygen OS11 will deviate from stock Android UI , might have to think twice before buying."
658,Sarin,Not worth the price,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using one plus 3 from past 4 years. By expecting same quality and features ordered the phone and very much disappointed with the quality and the performance. Camera is just like any other Chinese phones and it has so much whitening effects and low quality. Battery is draining so fast and after the os update it became little better. This phone is not worth the price and cannot be compared with the previous one plus mobiles
659,Dhanesh,Avoid very ordinary phone only advantage being 5g ready,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kind of fat ,heavy and bulky... Looks very ordinary, I took the blue one...Heats up very soon...camera at low light is terrible...and only the main camera quality is decent ...the rest of the camera r just for gimmick..battery is decent...also the auto light is too dim to be visible to read.. not impressed at all with this one plus offering...main problem being the thickness and weight of the phone.."
660,Parth,A Bad phone hyped to loot you,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Stock Android, minimal bloatware.On-screen fingerprint scannerCons:Performance- performs poorer than my 3 years old OnePlus 5.Lag in using apps - doesn't feel like more than a 12-15k phone.Camera - pic quality is that of a 12k device.A waste of money mid range phone."
661,Harsha,Don't buy it...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after 1 month of usage,the phone which spoiled one+ brand ... Lot of things disappointed me..1. Battery not lasting for 12 hours on normal basic usage(no games, no video streaming,no hotspot usage)2.Camera quality poor photos looks like 8mp camera3. Finger print reader response very low4. Phone heating issues5.poor ram managementPros:1.Design & look2.Display quality3. Pure android feel"
662,Nahush,Good midranger phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone almost for one month now....I have one major issue...that is the image processing....it takes a while after the image is captured...if you capture and immediately move your hand, the image will be blurred...I hope one plus listens to this major drawback of this phone....otherwise it's a good midranger phone....the battery life is pretty good ... fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't identify fingerprint.... camera quality is not as great as the brand has promised but it's still good not bad actually"
663,Daulat Singh,Very happy after bought this phone😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Definately your are very happy after you bought one plus nord like phone because it will provided all features in 30k which will not provided when we are compare to others phone. I am thankful to Amazon also because of rapidly delivery system.Camera is very good in focusing nd taking very clear photos. If you  are work in office then you didn't need to carry charger with you because of its battery life. Thank you team one plus nord and Amazon ❤️
664,Varun Sehgal,Go for it.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Game changer in the segment and pricing. The Plastic finish could have been improved. The Functionality, Camera and Refresh speed is what you seek at this price band. I would say go for this one if you frequently love to change phones every year and a half , top up and buy another and continue this trend rather being burdened with a 50K phone and get bore and still get stuck for resale. Live in present , evolve with changing times."
665,harshini,Really good at a great price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A really great phone for the price.90Hz screen is awesome and so snappy. The cameras are good too. Except the macro one. But I knew what I was getting into so can't complain.Battery life is great too. Lasts me a day to a day n a half at times, the charging is superfast.Really appreciate OnePlus sending a cover in the box too.The only thing missing really is the headphone jack. But I'm using the c-type converter cable and it works just fine. Will recommend using the original converter by OnePlus though."
666,shubhan ullah khan,Please check below,3.0 out of 5 stars,  All over its a good package but it's not the best out there in the market1) if you are a gamer especially if you play pubg then please don't buy it now as oneplus has confirmed that they will roll out an ota update for the frame rate setting first let it come and check the review and but itCarema is decentBattery is a major issue it's drains like anything even when you're not using the phone so please keep in mind.**However the overall the experience is damn good phone is pretty smooth RAM management is pretty osum.***All to all of you are lite user then close your eyes and go for it :)
667,Gayatri Virmani ,Does not live upto the hype,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Does not detect my fingerprint. Have to try at least 5 times. The camera quality is okay. Not excellent. I've been using it for a week now and my new Nord hangs at times. The screen goes bonkers. For a new phone the battery life also isn't upto the mark. It drains pretty quickly and I have to charge at least twice a day.I was really looking forward to this phone. Waited 2 months to get mine. But somehow the phone does not live up to the hype.
668,RK,Substandard Quality Product,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I personally feel that company's decision to lower the price(which is actually not so lower) with reduced quality rather substandard quality is not a worthy decision. और अभी तो oneplus 10000 की सेग्मेंट मे भी आना चाह रहा है तब ना जाने क्या हाल होगा? It's Front camera is pathetic and main camera having four camera. Out of which 2 really not required. इस फोन को हाथ मे लेकर प्रीमियम feel नहीं आ रहीं है. 28000 rupees कहीं से भी मिड रेंज नहीं कहलाती. इसका actual दाम 20000 से नीचे होना चाहिए दोस्तों.
669,vishakh g s,A Good allrounder....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord comes with1. Clean OS , 90 hz refresh  with amoled display2. Nice haptics3. Decent Camera and Battery4. Features like alert slider and in display finger print scanner.5. SD 765G chipset is fast enough for gaming.Quality of videos from this device is outstanding and also the good sound capturing.Areas to improve is:Images quality is not upto mark . 2 MP macro cam is useless. Even if there is a depth sensor , edge detection are not upto mark whrn shoot in potrait mode.No headphone jack , slight pinkish tint developed in display sometimes. And there is no always on display ."
670,mayank sharma,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My first impressionFor a start its a very handy phone, feels good in the hands not heavy and the functionality is worth the hype.I was looking for something low key and I found this device to be very apt for the purpose. Camera is good, processing is good,  sound is good.It's a overall good phone.Will be absolutely certain post a week's time."
671,Jitendra D,Camara is worst . Terrible experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not worth the money.  Especially if you are looking for a good camera. This is the worst choice.I am not a techie but as a user this phone was a big disappointment . The camera is the biggest problem.  The photos have no sharpness.No matter how firmly you hold the device (conciously) majority of the pictures are blurredIt takes few seconds atleast for the focus to be ready for the click.The portrait mode is the most terrifying experience. The background blurring result is extremely poor , Even Mi & vivo does the brilliant job .Pls don't buy if you are looking for a good camera ."
672,Prakhar,Decent buy,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Decent phone for this price. Should have taken the 7T instead for 8k more.
673,Aadil ahmad,Hype ka naajiyz fayda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  No doubt display is very nice, but minimum brightness has been locked may due to tinting issue. It creates issues due in the night specially when u watch movies etc. speaker is good not best. Camera is worst. I think poco f1 was shooting better pics than NORD. Focus issue is also there. Front camera is nice but edge detection and boundaries need to be corrected.Battery is also draining too fastly that tooo by minimal use. Not worth this price. Its 8/128 should have been at 24000 only."
674,Rakesh,"Overall it's ok, 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall it's ok, 4/5.Some display green and pink tint issue is there still after update which can be noticed. I contacted Oneplus customer care number and they are saying it's not at all a issue, it will be cleared in further updates. Hope it will be cleared soon. Camera is decent good outputs. Battery is the key screen on time in 90Hz approx. 7hrs on a medium usage. Normal user can get it 1.1/2 day easily.For the price range and brand value it's value for money looks premium."
675,SUJAY KUMAR S,Good,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome product! I like it. But the battery backup is just ok not excellent. What I don't like is that the selfie cam could be better..not upto the expectations. And also the inbuilt AppLock is poor...offers less security.. we are not able to put lock for settings
676,Gouranga mandal,Camera rectification required,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  What i wanted, sAmoled display, a 5g facility as we going to use this phone at least for 2years, and the last one but not the least is CAMERA, very dissapointing that at first 1+ giving ad that nord is flagship camera phone, honestly a 10k budget phone give better pic than nord. Oneplus need to correct this. And i believe that oneplus will find some way to rectify this. As a software developer 1+ provide better experience for their customers."

678,Amazon Customer,Poor quality phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Miserable experience with one plus nord. Failed miserably on drop test. My son dropped it by mistake on floor...

679,Amazon Customer,Good hands feel Mobile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earbuds/phone enroll during launch for purchasing Nord in aug20 they will receive coupon for purchasing earbuds/phone, but i haven't received the same,One thing the sim tray ejection and microphone hole both looking same it is big problem, we initially checked in micro phone for sim tray ejection,Hand feel is very nice, camera battery not checked fully"

681,Pragya thakur,Nice phone with good specs.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is pretty good at this price. You can definitely go for it.Front camera works very well as compare to rear camera. Rear camera needs to be improved by the updates. Performance is very fine as expected and 90hz display enhance your experience. Battery backup is fine as it goes for one day with single charge with heavy usage and it charges the phone in almost 1.20 hours.Experience on oxygen OS is damn good. And in hand feel of the phone is great as It's not that big and bulky.But there is a display tint issue and it is visible only in the dark but it will not affect you in any way. So just go for it.
682,Disha Dahake,A beast of midrange,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I think it was worth the 30k. Totally loved it. After reading some reviews even i got skeptical but i found no such issues of screen tint or battery drain. Camera is not bad, its still nice. If you are swithing from mid range devices you will totally fall in love with this phone else all iphone and oneplus 8 users would find it less premium whoch is obivious"
683,Pankaj,Below 25 k recommend to buy.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used this device last around 20 days. I used this phone in the night continuously 4-5 days. After using this itching started in my eyes. I immediately stoped to use this. My eyes are ok now. But I am using Samsung since long, Never feel such bad thing in my eyes. Presently using Nord and Samsung both. Weight and Speed of the phone is good."
684,Pooja Chavan,Awesome Phone bynone plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome phone. Phone delivery was much more earlier than expected date. Phone packaging was good. Includes Red club membership and welcome letter by one plus. Camera quality and audio is very good. Value for money. Recommended in this price range and best launch by One Plus. The only thing which could be better is battery. It gets low soon if you use your phone continuosly..
685,Ashish Barmase,Don't buy if you use starmaker/smule or similar karaoke apps,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this for my mother and she uses starmaker and similar karaoke apps. infact that apps are her lifeline, this phone does not have 3.5 mm, so I bought Type-C to 3.5mm conveter ORIGINAL oneplus.. but alas there is audio delay issues in recording and hear-back voice on all of such apps. Want to buy directly type-C headphoses but currently none available in online and offline market, visited chroma etc. but not avaialbe not even on oneplus website. what is the point if they are not keeping compatible accessory with the phone. cheaters."
686,Aditi Shelake,Totally worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is terrific! For those who can't afford expensive oneplus 7 or 8, this phone comes for rescue. Overall, it's a best deal at this price for a brand like oneplus. I have used it just for 3 days now and really happy with it. Will update my review after few months of use."
687,Venky,Awesomeness 😎,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  We have lot of video's and reviews about the phone being good/bad, I went a head and bought the mobile because I loved it. To be very honest the phone is good, the build quality, battery life, vivid colours, everything is good. If you ask me just buy stuff that you like and go for it ☺️"
688,Jenish H.,Nord is an emotion!😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So here with the Nord in hand! Powerful machine I have ever used! The fluidity in the usage is God! Love the interface and the free bloatware Android usage. Oxygen os does improve the performance of the chipset!I don't know why everyone complain about the camera which is not that bad. Actually speaking, the best camera I would say and the pictures speak!Cons:1. Fingerprint reader is not that accurate. Sometimes it's really annoying in unlocking the phone. Please fix this with the upcoming updates.I find this as an only con for me!"
689,Patricks ,"Bluetooth issue(not solved by updates),Fast battery drain,Charging speed slow,Camera Quality is bad",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus gave Bluetooth connectivity issue in gift to customers buying Nord phone, Even after update bluetooth problem is not solved ,it's very annoying that phone doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and when u use bluetooth headset ,ur headset will disconnect in between of use and will not connect and even my bluetooth headset is One plus Wireless Z Bluetooth bullets.ALSO, battery drains very fast and charging is not as fast as it is claimed , Camera Quality is very bad ,One plus is loosing it's good customer because of Issues in their phones now.figer print reader is ok and camera is ok ok."
690,Akash Kumar,Thank you oneplus ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using iphone for many years , recently oneplus has impressed me with its products. This is one such oneplus mobile you will fall in love with , an absolutely stunning mobile. Mobile looks premium in your hand , glass back finish is excellent.

693,DR.,Value for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Packaging very good. Delivery very fast. After using 5 days, following pros and cons have been experienced by me.Pros-. Display, Unique Plastic cover in the box, Red cable card, Doesn't seems plastic body on back, Camera at par with the competition brands,Cons-. Battery drainage very fast and charging time as claimed by the company, 5G option will be updated in future system update. Limited camera filter options, front camera not as expected."
694,Bishnupada Ghosh,Display & Camera,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's amazing & disheartening that One Plus Nord is unworthy of its price. Pictures taken with the phone shows green tint. The icons are more or less yellow in color. Red colored Icons are deep brown. When keyboards are used the Emojies are yellow in color. Find no ways to correct these problems. You should have the option of return. It""s really wastage of money for a retired person of 74 years old."
695,Alan Alexander,Quality product with an affordable price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Much awaited smart phone from One Plus. The high end version just compensates all the requirement of a smartphone guy.The performance & screen size is commendable.Only one to improve is the camera quality which was expected to match it's flagship models.
696,Rajat Gupta,Buy 7t instead,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Buy 7t instead. Better camera, better processor, better build quality.Dual front punchhole on Nord does not look good. Cameras ( both front and back) are average. Oxygen OS is good. Connectivity, call quality, mono speaker also good.Overall value for money."
697,Khageswar Achary,Oneplus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice product but overpriced OnePlus nord
698,Rishi Koushik,Good phone but facing the tint issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone has good battery life, good camera, really fast charging, smooth 90Hz amoled display. This would have been a 5 star review from me, but the device I own has the purple tint issue at sub 20 brightness on gray backgrounds. It doesn't affect my everyday usage much but it does get irritating to see some times."
699,ashish prasanna,Lives to expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Lives upto expectations. Good quality. Fairly average on everything else. I'm stuck to OnePlus because i love the OS. The best stock Android mod
700,Abilash,Awesome 👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well ,all i need is a bloat free os and great camera and OnePlus got my back .Of course there's green purple tint issue under 20 brightness only on grey background. Recent Amoled screen panels have the same problem even on brands like rog, samsung, Huawei. hope oneplus fixes it on upcoming updates."
701,Som,Not satisfied this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  My phone is not working may be there is a defective piece send by Amazon many problems are there like restart many times nd pdf file not open phone says not supported files nd there is no return option there is only replace option so plz think before buy this product
702,Devraj,Go For It,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pretty much nice phone honestly.I mean i was in doubt whether to buy it after reading the negative reviews but i finally did and i donot regret about this.Some people were saying about the camera is very bad but its pretty good actually.The fingerprint reader is smooth and Oxygen OS is swift like butter and battery life is good.The phone gets charged very very fast due to 30w warl charger.It works smoothly and doesnot hang for a bit even after running too much applications.No heating issue till nowOverall a good phone.
703,viswanatha reddy,I Really loved this product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really awesome product, it charges 60% within 20mins,Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)Display quality also superb. Touch sensors verg accurate and speed. Nice product from OnePlus, thank you one plus."
704,Amazon Customer,Decent phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  My first one plus phone. I dislike Chinese phones for the bloat ware that comes with phone. But oxygen OS is just like stock Android. Mobile feels good in hand. Back cover is sturdy enough to continue with it without buying a spare immediately. Screen guard provided with phone is very thin. One plus says it is to keep the on-screen fingerprint better sensitive.I am not a big fan of camera. I use it for general purpose. Camera is decent for normal use.No tint issue as told by many sites. Atleast to me.Happy with purchase.
705,Utsav Aggarwal,Just go for it ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   I was so happy when I received it. Idk why there are so many negative reviews because of them I was so double minded but the product is perfect. If you're thinking to buy just go for it. It's way faster than the mobiles in this range and it can easily beat some mobiles a little higher than the nord. Everything's great and I'm happy with it. I was also unsure of the color but when I got it, I knew it was the perfect choice. I used for a whole day and the battery backup is also good it can easily last from morning to night. Oneplus really did a good job"
706,Gaurav Porwal,Nice Product,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I really liked this product a lot. but there are some cons like the front camera is not that good and also the macro doesn't click good pictures.I have to say this Amazon Customer Service is not that good. I constantly tried to get my product delivered on time but they refused to provide any reason until i posted order details on Twitter.
707,Rahim Raza,Disappointed fingerprint reader...It takes time and sometimes doesn't work at all.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good experience with the mobile using since 1 month... Very much happy with the ram management for 12 GB of this device.Camera and battery has been much optimized after some regular updates... Yet I'm not totally satisfied with its fingerprint reader , although its face recognition system during screen lock meets a much better preference than fingerprint service."
708,siddharth trivedI,Not recommended to buy.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Bad product from oneplus...never expected to get such bad quality in this range. The battery quality was not at all good. The heating issue is there in the device. Smoothness was not in the phone while using. What they advertise and what the customer receive is par different.
709,Shourya Kumar,Why u should buy it,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone is gking thrlugh a lot of controversy but consider some things1)this is a newly launched and it will get many updates over time2)You get the feeling of the heavenly oxygen os in just 28k3)sure battery is a lil unoptimized but it will get optimized over time with updates3)Most important camera eill be updated as the people sitting at one plus are super comfy in their os and will fix it asap4)It's just 28k
710,No-one,CAUTION: Think before buy & Test throughly after buy !,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have already ordered a replacement after speaking with the Amazon customer executive for almost 2 Hours.OnePlus QA is poor. Display doesn't provide pure white. The replacement phone too has Black Crush issue.Recently Bluetooth pairing issue too is observed.Better check before buy or buy it in a outlet Experience store.Mayans S1E4 on Disney+Hotstar to check Black crush issue.
711,Amazon Customer,"worth for 30,000 rs.(i bought 12gb/256 ) variant.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  MY HONEST REVIEW:everybody knows about the advantages,let me say the disadvantages1. it carries fingerprint smudges very well.(from the 1st day itself)2.heating issues.(i use it continuosly for online classes-like 4-5 hours).(continuous 2hr usage we can feel the heat..but ..thats not an major issue)that's it.other than this i felt no problems(like for 1 month i have used,while writing this answer).and i am a normal user (no gaming) and i have to say onething...it has an amazing SUPER CHARGER....man that's really incredible fast.FINALLY : worth for the price."
712,shahidjaha,Waste of money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery discharged so quickly, even though if u charge the mobile for 100 percentage it wil drained within the 2-3 hours(use instagram and the whatsapp only)So the same coast I go for real me which is far better than OnePlus nord don't go for itWaste of money battery quality not up the mark"
713,Amazon Customer,I have a defected phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I've been using this phone for over 3 days and I find it extremely slow . I thought speed was one of the selling points for nord. After using it for gaming I can see a very visible lag while scrolling or moving from one screen to the other . The video quality isn't great either YouTube videos look blurry no good detailing whatsoever.The camera is not great at all .macro mode is a gimmick. I don't know if I have a defected phone or is it the same problem with other phones as well. Highly disappointed for a much awaited phone
714,SUBHAM GHOSH,Loved it except the battery life,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life should be improved.Other wise it's a great value for money & a perfect device for day to day uses.
715,samuel,"Simple and boring, they don't have anything of there own everything is taken from Google",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am first time using OnePlus product OnePlus Nord, honestly it is not much impressive everything it has is stock Google  things, you will not enjoy the oxygen OS, I would say samsung and Mi is more better in experience OnePlus everything thing is very simple on OnePlus..it has only the brand name that's it, you will get bored using it, think before buy or experience it somewhere else in store go for Samsung or Mi , OnePlus is less in features very simple & boring.they don't have anything of there own everything is taken from Google. OnePlus is good for its design and built that's it."
716,jahir,One plus Nord Something missing and issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Google play AR services not compatible and IR not supported this device idon't know if it is possible to OnePlus updates, cemara quality 48 mp not available zoom option available only 12 mp, photos clarity some place blurring night time blurring photo,when we have transferred vivo to OnePlus Nord upto 5 gp data bulk of files using inshare application heating issue occurred in one plus Nord but not heating vivo 1601.otherwise okAnd one more thing for AR issue resolved by another app full fill Arloopa that very useful for childrens. Heating issue occurred when charging and bulk file transfer."
717,Sareen Shah,OnePlus experience at a cheaper price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros -1. Excellent AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate. (Ignore the tinting issue hype as it does not cause any problems in day-to-day usage)2. Smooth Oxygen OS experience - No ads and extremely fast!3. Fast charging and decent battery life4. Good build quality (Though it is plastic frame, it is quite sturdy)Cons -1. Processor could have been a better one (Though 765G not at all a bad one)2. Pricing could have been a bit less.Overall, its a nice phone!"
718,ashish mohan khare,Not the best but good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery drains a bit fast if u have watches paired with it or if u r using it as a HOTSPOT,camera quality is good,processor is smooth, fingerprint sensor is fast & accurate ...overall Not the best but good phone"
719,Paras Neupane,Awesome Nord📱,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  While unboxing camera quality and battery life was not upto the mark, but after upgrades the camera quality and battery life is awesome. The phone is fully charged in around one hour, also for charging 10-15mins you can use your phone whole day with optimum use.Only thing you miss in this product is 3.5mm Jack, if anyone face issue in Jio Network i.e. because of call over wifi setting enabled, you just need to switch the setting to call over mobile network in Calling preference menu.Thanks OnePlus for the awesome product."
720,Vishal Chauhan,Camera Quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors.The colours are crisp without any unwanted over saturation and the images come with a good amount of detail. But the experience of the camera depends a lot on the overall lighting and the lens you are using.
721,Nikhila kr,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life and charging is really good that too for a 90hz screen. Display is the best and I don't have a green tint issue. The phone is really smooth and OS is very clean. Camera is not as flagship level and it was honestly terrible at the beginning. But it has improved since the special update Nord received. I installed Gcam and it is amazing much better than stock. Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price and little bit of future proof as 5G is coming.
722,pulkit,Summary of oneplus nord,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Guys battery quality is worst, it drains so fast and mobile heats very fast.Camera is average its not very good as oneplus gives in other mobiles.Built quality is also not very good as oneplus 7t.It is better to invest 7000 more and buy oneplus 7t that also I have and its the best phone in the range"
723,Amazon Customer,Useless product One plus Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Useless product by this Co. who always gave a better product. Features are lower even than two year old model ""One plus 6"", pathetic offer by the Co.Due to some reason, could start using the phone only two days before, return window is closed, but, heavily regret my decision to have opted for this model.All future purchases shifting to Samsung / Apple. Never to suggest anyone for ""One plus"".Why do you have to offer a low grade model when you raise the bar already. Extremely disappointed by this purchase."
724,Rahul Gupta,Good buy with compromise on camera quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is awesome at this range.Mobile charging time, battery backup, finger print reader like feature is very satisfying. Phone works with very good speed while using any app or browsing data.One thing painful is it's Picture quality taken from camera. It's start getting blurred even with small zoom. So, you should not buy this mobile if you are crazy to click photos on every occasion through mobile.Otherwise it's a good buy at this range."
725,Devika❤,Boooom!! Good Buy!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  For me the phone is pretty good.Actually most of us are not the pro players and not the photo creators for a national or international wide competitions.So the phone is more than enough for all the normal users like me and sufficient features and it gives the best of all. The processing speed is too fast and having 12 GB and 256 GB is abundant for whoever are planning to buy a new phone just because ur old phone is not working much.And Yeah the charging is too fast.For This prize I found it as price worthy and no need to change the phone for the next 3 years and even more!!
726,Sridhara Visali,Perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect buttery smooth oxygen OS,camera quality is good ,runs as fast as other flagship OnePlus devices but not in gaming .Gaming works pretty well and don't expect flagship level gaming at this price point in OnePlus brand.No phone meets every expectation of user .This phone is good for regular user.The battery lasts for 1day while heavy use and one and half day for normal user. The warp charge is excellent. I didn't observed any tint issue in display I think this display issue is not seen in recent bought devices .My display is sharp ."
727,Sidharth,Just amazing ⚡,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome phone. Battery life and camera quality are very good. Initially I was confused whether to buy realmex2 pro (sd855+) because of its processor. But I went for Nord and now I am sure that I made the right choice. Nord, being a new phone will get android updates for a couple of years and the sd765g is a very powerful processor. I had no issues with gaming and the gaming experience was wonderful. Plus, the oxygen os is just bliss. Undoubtedly, Nord is the best phone in this price range in my opinion."
728,Dream_catcher,Value of money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  5 out of 4.7...🙌.. Worthy. to buy. Performance also good , video streaming quality good but only issue when I watch movies the front camera module irritating otherwise good.. overall good and decent value for money. And 3 problem I face and commoon ;- 1 is headphone jack missing and frame made plastic and not stereo speakers missing.. overall good.. OS, wrap charging fast 30 mint.;- 70% . charging ,, when full charge on screen time 4 to 5 hours continues. Gaming also good .. overall good experience .."
729,saurav suman,Best device to have in this price range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Absolute beast with some minor UI bugs.Although display have some green tint issue with 90hz mode not with 60hz.Also day to day usage is very fluid .You don't get this type of user experience with any other device in this price range.Camera is decent not like flagship as they hyped it.Battery backup is also decent with almost 7hrs SOT.Overall if you are a gamer don't go for this go for OnePlus 8 or something like 800series processor devices.As i am not a gamer..i am utmost satisfied with this product.Using from 8 days .
730,Shivani Sharma,Satisfied with this Nord bundle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using it for over 20 days, I would like to point out one big dislike - the screen near fingerprint reader has noticeable tints. You can notice it while watching videos, playing games. Secondly, camera quality in low light is not so good, but in good lighting, you can see the images are pretty good. You can see the red color varieties and its distinction. Battery life, video and gaming experience is worth it for a phone at this cost price. If you want a durable mobile, go for it without a doubt."
731,Sharanamma Palled,U get more than wat u pay for,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone in the price segment , u will get more than wat u paid for .I have attached few images clicked in12mpMacro48mpFor me image quality is above average and satisfied with colours and contrast.Screen is amazingly smoothBattery is good , for a moderate users u will be left with 15-20% by the end of the day, that means u are good to go .Speakers are satisfactory , they are loud and better.No colour tint I experienced in my phone.Charges as expected . Warp charging is a bliss."
732,Monikuntal Phukan,"Nothing great, a 15k phone will provide same performance",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  While it has high RAM and storage, but the internal processor is not powerful enough to support the same. Camera quality is also very basic. Better to spend few additional thousands and opt. for galxy series with much better performance in all department.."
733,Nikhil,Worst product ever.....after sale service is also too bad no review for my complaint till now,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Dont know why they have launched such bad phone when they are not able to resolve any query of customers totally unsatisfied with this phoneWorst product ever i have ever purchased from amazon..... facing problem since i have purchased the phone and no customer service is responsing to my issue..... Guys you should not waste your money on this worst phone totally useless and second I have never seen such bad after sale service of any company.....you should think twice before buying this phone.....thats all my review for OnePlus
734,vineet,Review after 1 month usage.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  When I switched from 10k to 28k .I was bit nervous weither it will be appropriate to invest on such device but according to me 28k is bit high price 25k is perfect for this varient .Pros.1.good battery backup2.look like a premium phone3.display is excellent4.speaker is loud5.day light photo is perfect6.oxygen os is goodCons.1.low light camera struggle.2.dont have seperate password for app lock.3.According to me little bit expensive.
735,arvind k.,Phone is defective and very thin line is seen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  On Phone screen from 15 day i purchase i started noticing and thin line, which is seen on white back ground and after 1 month I started searching for service center 2 listed in website but only one is working  and when i showed them they told they want to replace the screen and i asked for replace but they denied. it was a defective peace only. but this service people not agreeingPhone is not worthy of what is paid, not at all happy with phone performance and service center"
736,Raji Thanik,Disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using this one plus nord (12gb,256 varient) for a week. I'm new user to one plus series ,So was much excited to buy this mobile. Now I'm so much disappointed battery life of the mobile is so worst, I need to charge my mobile every 6 hours even with low usage, camera quality is not even like redmi. SIM is not working properly, everytime it's coming as switched off. Other than classy look everything else is disappointed"
737,Raghu,Pathetic Camera by OnePlus Standards !,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera is no where close to OnePlus 6T which is two year old phone. On spec comparison everything seems better. But practically the phone is really bad. I purchase Nord 5G 256GB +12GB RAM model and sold to cashify for 22k. 8k loss for usage of a day. A Big No to this Phone. Dont buy.
738,Sai v.,Great at this price with OxygenOs being one of the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:1.Inscreen fingerprint works perfectly2. Colors are good and display is great3. Oxygen OS is very easy to use & got almost everything you need4.front camera is good in normal light conditions and ultra wide view is useful5.looks good at this price6. Warp charging works wellCons:1. Photos taken in low light are not impressive2. OnePlus says phone will brighten screen in dark for face unlock but sometimes doesn't work properly like works 6-7/10 times3. Audio from phones speakers is average.
739,Amazon Customer,Bit of over do with cameras,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Straight to the point:- Camera is awful. Pixels distort and too much of beautification/filters applied. Consider macro lens does not exist because it is useless.- Battery is life just average like any other mid range phones.- Overall build quality and performance is smooth for 30 bucks price range.
740,ranjeet singh,Battery backup is very poor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery is draining faster even with low or moderate usage.Battery backup is very poor. Even I have not installed any games yet. Only instagram, Facebook and songs like normal daily work. Then also it is draining too fast. Only 4_5 hours of screen on time with normal routine work. Highly disappointed."
741,Yusuf Kulkarni ,Good product at this range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone for about a month...This is really a good phone in mid range for avg use . The software is at its peak with oxygen OS performing great .  Coming to its battery performance = it is quite good , one can use it for whole day ..... I won’t personally recommend this phone for the people who are obsessed with mobile photography becoz the camera quality is not that great ...it’s just okay for regular use ... 90hz refresh rate is really good ,you can feel the difference.... would say that this phone is really good at this price range ."
742,Keshav,Front camera not impressive,3.0 out of 5 stars,  As we know oneplus try to do better always but in this product oneplus left some mistakes like front camera not impressive .Front camera is so bad quality pictures .Speakers are not impressive .And very things is good as like prize .Plastic body we can adjust but camera not adjustable
743,Nilesh kumar,"Phone is good ,but battery life 50 50",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi viewers,On the time pre-book , I booked phone and I was curosity for Nord phone . After used one week I found some issue which aa the followingProns : if you talk about phone then I saw good and size and weight (light weight) are standard and pretty UI of android 10 .Cons : Battery life less , but it's depend upon the usage . But I observed ,if oneplus will do more work on battery life .As per my usage 100 to 15 % came in 5 hour .Over all phone is good and minimum budget onePlus gave best for users."
744,Manoj k,"Excellent camera, super build",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super bright screen , excellent camera performance both in day and night. Responsive fingerprint scanner.sturdy build quality. Battery shulould have been large atleast 5000mah. Otherwise super phone much better than other chinese phones."
745,Anjali ,The best midrange phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after using it for 1 week. It's a awesome phone with lots of new things. Best camera both the rear and front one. Battery life is not that great. It manages to last for only one day with moderate use but not to forget about the fast charging. Overall I would say a nice phone, stylish with good camera and you can customise the display, color and many other things as just you want your phone to be.Thank you One Plus for bringing this midrange phone to the market."
746,Tilak,Product with broken screen and amaozn failed to replace.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Highly disappoint with Amazon being a prime member. Deffective product with broken screen delivered after waiting for over 21days. Even after technical engineer confirmation of product defectiness amaozn not able to replace with new phone and ask to wait for another 10days time. This is highly disappointing, request you to arrange replacment without further delay. Since i have not use the phone yet can't comment on quality."
747,MohmedMaaeez Malek,"30k phone with an average camera, average battery life",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Actually I am not a heavy user so this phone works fine for me but One Plus claimed that the battery charges from 0-70% in 30 mins which is actually false. In 30 mins it charges from 0-55%. The camera is average, takes 1-2 seconds to process after clicking the photo; if you immediately move it away after clicking the photo, then the photo gets blurred. Battery life is normal, it lasts for more than a day on normal usage.Buy it if you want a OnePlus experience."
748,komal,Not worth it,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I brought new one plus nord on 2nd if September.It getting hanged sometime.There is always bluetooth connectivity problem it get disconnected automatically.Screen is going blank sometimes when I switched between application.Sound keeps playing for 5-6 second if I switch from youtube to another application.And there is network problem I have to restart the phone 3-4 times a day as it showed my phone out of coverage area or switched off .
749,Haresh,Phone misses basic functionality,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Oneplus as a brand i purchased the Oneplus Nord. But i would suggest Honor i.e huwai phone and software is excellent. Oneplus Nord missing basic functionality like whenever i call there is an mute button on phone which gets pressed in every call multiple times. I think oneplus team has missed to give focus on the basic calling functionality. There is no option to remove mute button. Further phone doesn't have basic copy feature like u can't copy selected text from sms you want. Entire message gets copied.Only Look wise and other features are good.
750,Swapnil,OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros-Ease operationGood cameraSlim designValue for moneyGet less warmCons-Battery life is just ok, you need to charge it 2 times approx in a day without using battery saver.That's why stopping for battery at 3 stars, otherwise would given 5."
751,Libin,#Best Product From The Best Brand# but the tyndall issue is there,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  All round it is a best phone for normal people.It is an amazing product."" But there is a display issues(tyndall issue)"",no camera issue, but the battery draining is little more ! But we can believe that the oneplus software updates will be fix it soon. The fingerprint sensor is so fast and smooth. Lightweight is an important factor. It is much better when it comes with aluminium frame and Snapdragon 845 G processor.I feel better with this phone because I waited for a long time to get a better product. #Comparatively 1+  Nord is a best choice compare with realme X3# *(just my opinion)*"
752,Vinoth,Wothy Buy from Oneplus Brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Good overall performance phone.PROS:1.Display was awesome2.Good Daylight camera performance.3.Good battery backup with 30W dart charger4.90HZ display was smooth5.Gaming was smooth while playing in 90HZ mode.6.Got 3 updates within a week.(FutureProof phone)7.OXYGEN OS for smooth experience.CONS:1.Camera was average during lowlight2.No Headphone jack3.No Sterero speakersOverall - Good all rounder phone under 27K.Buy this phone without any second thought.
753,Nishant Sharan Roy,An all rounder with sub-par battery performance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  An all rounder however the only observable kink till this point is the battery performance. It's adequate for most of the daily use scenarios, except heavy gaming.Also, if you're looking to use the mobile cameras extensively, then install GCam rather than using the in-built camera app, because the difference is noticeable."
754,Md Musharraf Khan,OnePlus Nord Review after a Month,4.0 out of 5 stars,  1. Fingerprint is very fast and accurate.2. Battery life is above average.3. Camera quality varies with the updates as OnePlus sends more updates.4. Display : Yes their is a tint issue but it's not noticeable until u try to notice it.5.

Little bitAt Last thing think about Oxygen OS or Realme UI you will never regret on Oxygen
760,Narender Kumar,Not worthy at a cost of 30 K,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product  but trust me  not worth 30000 lots of important is required on this product.1 screen resolution is not healthy for eyes. One cannot look continus to screen it effect eyes.2 while recording any call it's announced to both that your call is being recorded. Which should not be a familiar features3 as heard earlier. Even multiple updates Camraa quality is not at par.4 if I have worth to spend 30k or more then lost of other branch are there in India which can opet to avoid above.
761,Prabakaran,Worst experience ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst experience ever never expected these kind of quality oneplus the crack which I have posted its shocking bcoz it has dropped from a height below the knee that too with the case on this will be my last product from oneplus hats off for your quality and support guys

768,Amazon Customer,Writing after one month usage,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am so lazy to write a review  for any of my orders in the past few years. But this phone bought with a total of 32k (along with insurance for 12GB version) fully disappointed me. Writing this after one month of usage. I had better experience with me Redmi.Repeatedly hangs outBrowser performance is the worstAudio is poorAll other functions are same as other phones. No need to buy this much of a costly phone for an avg performance like a 13k mobile.
769,Mudit Sharma,Got a defective piece,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Completely disappointed got a defective item the speaker of the phone is not working although they refund my money but got a defective piece from a brand like one plus it sucks!!
770,Eswar,Over Hyped not up to the Mark...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  After using more than a week i feelCameras average. 2MP micro camera is literally sucks. 5MP dept cam is for namesake.Main camera takes good shots in day-time.Battery life is very good.Fingerprint scanner is avarage.Refreshrate not smoother as expected.Processor is small upgrade of 730G dont expect like flagship performance. Decent at gaming no heating Thanks for good optimization. Final verdict this phone is over priced... better go with 730g processor Mobile with stock Android will feel same experience.

773,manikandan,unexpected camera quality and output awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The OnePlus Nord is a fantastic mid-range smartphone, and one that betters its main competition in a number of ways.From its large number of cameras to its 90Hz refresh rate, 5G, AMOLED screen, slick software and modern, mostly premium design, this phone packs in an awful lot for not very much money.It’s clear where cost taking about 28000rs modeland batter life very disappointment because when your open the camera take to high resolution video recode that the time battery life is down quickly ..."

Batery life is regularly normal since I've used for one day, I couldn't find any big drop in battery with regular use even I played pubg, used camera, watched video etc.3. I have seen many reviews mentioning the display issue, there are no display issues. I am also using dark mode with less brightness.4.

Refund post return was processed but no one is coming to pick the phone. Ordered this for my fiance who is going to US and will be without a phone because of this!!Ridiculous experience. Not expected from One Plus and surely not from Amazon. Really poor."

791,Avinash S.,High performance specs but average performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing configuration of processor,12gbram, quad camera at relatively lesser cost was a surprise, but it's not very smooth, touchscreen is very average, while gaming the touchscreen fails to recognise all the fingure moments. Camera quality is also average and so is the battery backup which requires charging more than once a day with regular usage (in next few months it will degragde)With specs had really high expectations but I think I was even good with 16k mobile as the performance is still the same."
792,Jyoti,It's not a bad deal but could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  1) My only disappointment is with battery life. It last barely a day with full charge.

It gets the job done."

You have only choice to lock the phone and unlock.Kindly do something about that. And many other problems with os or something.
794,E K.,ONEPLUS NORD,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All over it's an immense package of speed with style. Fingerprint reader is quiet fast. Camera can be improved with future updates although it's very good as of now. Battery life is bareable as 30W Warp charger charges up the device really quick. The back is also glass with Gorillla Corning glass so you can use it without a back cover. I am Completely satisfied with The Oneplus Nord.
795,Nikunj,Phone is flickering on every app.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone with loads of good hopes, but it disappointed me very hugely. I am experiencing flickers while scrolling many apps like Google, slo motion videos, gallery and every apps.My expectations shattered since I came to know that I have to run 30 kms to service center for this problem.

796,Pratheek R,Best phone under 30K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the good phone under 30K cost. Happy with the Google default applications and performance. If you compare this product with any of the same cost phone, you'll end up with more positive things. But don't compare with other products having cost greater than 35K / 40K. For normal users, it'll be the best phone according to me."
797,varun,Not worth penny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I suggestion NOT TO BUY.If your luck doesn’t favours you you face the problems mentioned below.Over rated hard ware specUnder quality software. Phone gets auto reboot , looses data. And coming to camera , there is a lag, you get the click sound but the later moment is getting captured.When using camera phone gets heated up. Called customer care about these issue, they recommend factory reset.... but in vain."

799,Prathamesh Salgar,My opinion about this phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus phone and I wanna tell OnePlus that their quote of (Never Settle) is actually true because this phone is a flagship killer phone for camera, speakers, display and the 90hz refresh rate this is a monster in the hands of professional photographers and what I disliked about it is the gaming qualityIt cannot run PUBG at 60fps and the battery life pretty good and the fingerprint reader & the face unlock is fast AF!!!!!!!!!! Thats all I wanted to say (THANK YOU ONEPLUS I LOVED THIS PHONE)"

801,Shreya Sanghvi,Definately overhyped!!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nord is definitely overhyped to the next level , but the price is good and it is not the best OnePlus device nowhere near oneplus8 camera is the weakest point the third camera for the Bokeh mode is not even used when you hide the third camera and click on portrait mode of the picture quality is still the same , if you have no problem with camera go for it , or increase your budget and go for oneplus8, overall it's  a decent phone"
802,nitin,Butter smooth performance except battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Every thing is working fine.But there is battery drain issue in my device. Planning for replacement.

813,aman siraj,Everything is great except the camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's get straight to the point everything is great except the camera that too in low-light conditions, in low light conditions it is so bad that it looks cartoonised though gcam fixes it whereas it is brilliant outdoors and just like every android it laga a little on snapchat videosOverall a good buy!"

818,Khemchand S.,After using a week camera optimization is good but can made better by GCam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using OnePlus Nord for 1 week I can say that it's worth my money. I think for it's price range it's enough RAM and internal storage.Performance is also great.Only think concerning about this phone is camera but camera optimization can be tweaked by GCam app. I have tried it myself, and astrophotography is amazing.Overall I am happy with this phone.😀"
819,Pravin Nagare,DON'T PURCHASE!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Don't purchase it very low end device in high cost.My redmi note 8 pro was performing far better than this.In package display issue display looks pale.Pubg won't even run in high graphic and hd audio and I paid 30k for this crap device.Put some extra and go for 8 or 8 pro.Waste of money
820,Sanal Yasir,More than expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,  was little nervous while buying bcoz i have seen so many videos talking about camera quality and pointing out cons of nord but after getting this device i came to know about only one con which is speaker it is good only when volume is full otherwise u will have to struggle in hearing but overall phone is good worth spending 30k and camera is awesome i have compared it with one plus 8 pro and u can easily point out the difference that camera on one plus nord is far more better than one plus 8 pro.

824,Mohsin,Oneplus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Premium look... lightweight...(grey onyx) superb ..
825,Ankit Koshti,Value for price in mid range,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I won’t over sell this product but it is the beat mid range phone available now. Better than Samsung M and A series. I would always go for snapdragon processors than any home built processors.Looks good for the price and worth it
826,Arya chatterjee,OnePlus shuld nt do that,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Seriously OnePlus u shodnt do that to ur customers...the ph is overall good but the most worst thing I can't even bear is the camera front wala...disgusting it feels like we are going back to the 2 megapixel era with a big punchhole design...u hve gone mad bro or fooled us by creating this kind of huge hype
827,Kaushik,Awesome budget 5G ready phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pre-ordered on July 28th, and delivered on Aug 3rd l, before actual sale!!Phone is very good in terms of apps and games performance, smooth display, battery life, Oxygen OS, front camera. Back camera is not that great or at par with flagships, but still it takes pretty good photos under normal conditions, so on usual days, it will work great.Only complaint is regarding bloatwares of Facebook and Netflix apps. That could have been avoided to keep the OS as clean as possible."
828,Akanksha,Insta issues,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really don't know why this phone is not giving me a good instagram experience. I scroll through insta a lot. But in this phone, the stories are mostly blur, the theme keeps changing, and many more problems I guess I'll realise in near future. Also, the volume button takes a little time to respond, it's not instant. Plus, I wish the colour blue would have been the way they showed. A little disappointed but okay. It's a good value for money."
829,hrishikesh,A good daily driver.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing this review after a 1.5month of usage....After 2 updates the rear camera quality has increased but for selfies i still  prefer GCAM. Speakers are loud and good. 90hz display is something else probably the best feature of this phone. Battery backup is good. I get around 7-7.5hrs for normal usage and phone gets charged in 65-70mins. I haven't Noticed any lags whatsoever. Oxygen OS nails the software experience. In hand feel is premium.Overall all a very good daily driver.
830,shashank agarwal,Ok. But not so good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is pretty good. The Marble Blue colour is very eye catching. I'm writing this review after 15 days use. Two OTA updates are already provided for this phone. The problem with new update is that the charging is slow compared to the new one. The new one plus nord went 0 to 70 percent in just 30 mins. But now, it take 0 to 70 percent in 50 mins. Remaining all things are at there best. FP sensor is very fast. The phone has never hung. The phone never got heated. Front camera is also good."
831,Saranpreet,Superb Phone for today and the future,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Review after 1 week of usage ....Excellent phone with awsome camera ...No bloatware ....

Really happy with my NordJust go for it ..
832,Kalyani Charpe,Smart mid range phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice phone for the users who have medium to high usage. Would not recommend for the user who is expecting too much out of it. I would give 4.5 rating. -0.5 is because of camera quality onlywhich company mentioned to be of flagship i.e OnePlus 8 (which is not obviously). Other stuff are just perfectly fine.
833,Pankaj Meena,ABNORMAL TEMPERATURE RISING AND BLACK BAR IN LOW BRIGHTNESS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My OnePlus NORD heated abnormally sometime if just Youtube is playing it starts heating. Contacted amazon customer, they did diagnosis and found device temperature is more than 48degree(48.6).More than 45 degree temp may affect CPU, i got green tinted device. Although i got refund for this as replacement was not available. May be it is heating because of green tinted display(I DON'T KNOW).THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING NORD"
834,Amit Kumar Gupta,This is not a premium phone .

836,Krishna Reddy Mandala,Thought good to go but not...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good but no connectivity to ear phones and it over reacted in capturing photos in various weather conditions that made me surprised swtuching from iOS but end of the day you get for what you pay. iOS is my best experience so far with security features and simplification! Go for Nord from budget perspective.

843,Prasad,Camera and dark mode flicker issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera for both videos and pictures comes really bad, at this price you should get atleast an average cemera quality phone. I was really really disappointed in it. Also in dark theme mode the screen flickers and that too a phone that has been just 2weeks old. overall I would give just 1star."
844,Ashwini,Nord pre booking,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had purchased OnePlus nord in pre booking from Amazon which had started from 28th july. All the features of the phone are very impressive, but the company should have given 1 ear phone with nord."

846,Rajan M,The Best Budget Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am reviewing after 10days of use . The phone's speed and refresh rate is mind blowing . The charging is really fast . And the 256gb storage is really best at this budget price . Camera is also cool. We don't need a SD card too . They give a 50gb free cloud storage and The sound quality is also good . Finally The most liked thing is the packing .
847,Sunny,Waste of money: Battery and Camera Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst product, seems like 10,000 Rs product. Waste of money, as battery life is worst. It got charged fast as well as drain super fast. If it's 100% charged, it reduces to 10-20% battery level within 5-6 hours without heavy use (no game, video watching). Camera quality is also average. So this is not expected from such costly product. Only good thing is touch screen. But Camera and Battery are critical things."
848,Ruhul,A big disappointment,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There isn't any notification light. either to show the charging status or to notify calls, messages etc.Camera quality not as expected.The biggest problem with mine nord is the Hanging issue. Despite having 8GB RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, 2.4 GHz octa-core processor, It got hung while playing Carrom pool and while using Myntra. Haven't even installed any big application or any games of high graphics or storage."

I hated Android for it's bloatware but thanks OnePlus has taken care of it. Only thing I'm missing is iPhone retina display, that is no match anywhere."
851,Suhail Shaikh,Brilliant Phone at reasonable price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The cheapest phone in the 5g category. I see people commenting on issues with camera but they should understand that we are purchasing a mobile phone and not a DSLR camera. We should be looking into the voice quality, maybe video clarity and the speed of the processor. The mentioned features are absolutely fine of Nord. I had a given a star less because there is always a scope for improvement on all the aspects."
852,Sean f.,Not as good as OnePlus 6 and good for the price.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used to own OnePlus 6 and it's much better than OnePlus nord in every way. It's got headphone jack, it's camera is better, it's wider. It's thinner comparing with nord.Cons: front camera is placed in wrong position so pics are not good at all. It's thicker. It's litte bit slower than OnePlus 6. I"
853,SANNJAY S JOSHI,My first OnePlus product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a very nice smartphone. Camera quality is great, gives crisp and lovely pictures. Better than any other phone I have used till date. Battery charging is just unbelievable. Charges at around 11% every 5 minutes. 100% done in just over 45-50 minutes. Though till date, I have never charged beyond 95%. Do occasionally peek into the OnePlus community to see how others are doing. I am sure no one is unhappy with this product. I am certainly not !!!!"
854,Yogesh kale 8319540846,Awesome phone😍😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very light, easy to handle, cameras are good I kind of like the ultra wide selfie it's really wide! Ambient display plays a very important role. Fast (since I was using mi A1 before). Excellent performance, quick charge saves a lot of your time. I would have liked it with headphone jack but nevertheless we can use adapters. The headphone equaliser is pretty good. Rest just buy and use it😉"
855,Pankaj Kothari,Camera is not good. this not a one plus 8 camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera optimization is not good. When I was clicking the pictures from camera. There was some nice shots.

856,Amazon Customer,A really great midrange product 💯💯,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is great and got 3 system updates. After that the phone is working really good and camera is really good(it's not as bad as people criticized). I have personally taken a lot of photographs in nightscape, Pro mode and the normal mode the pictures are really very awesome.

857,Dheeraj s.,Front camera is not as expected. If you zoom the picture you won't find that quality.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had very hight expectation with the Camera, more specifically with the front. As we use it more for selfies. But that has disappointed me more. The quality, selfies in low light are pathetic. Don't buy if you are specifically looking for selfie camera. Might be possible it could be an issue with particularly with my device but untill I realise the replacement date was gone. I wish I could replace with another OnePlus Nord."

862,Amazon Customer,Great device,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is very good, infact provided almost all the necessary softwars required.Something I felt unusual is that during charging, my red cable becomes hot. I don't really know that it is a defect or it is happening with everyone.On this device, OnePlus has worked excellently and the most lovely thing about this is that it doesn't takes much time to charge. All over it is a good option but better options are available in the market in this price range."

909,Sujay,Just a phone with normal features but great OS !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a good attempt by one plus! The main camera works just fine but the macro camera is better not to be used.It's battery does a fine job but not as big as most budget phones that give us 9-10 hours of life. You can use it for atmost 6-8 hours.Price is much higher as compared to other phones with same features but Oxygen OS is a fulfilling ad free, bloatware free OS. That's the best takeaway from this phone."

922,Amazon Customer,Issue in Bluetooth Connectivity,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Big issue with Oneplus Nord is Bluetooth connectivity. Takes too long to connect bluetooth device, when connected it gets disconnect automatically. Onnplus should work more with bluetooth connectivity as the device do not have earphone jack.Camera quality is not good. Low durability due plastic/fiber frame. Not expected these qualities and issues from Oneplus.OS 10.5.7 is awesome to use."

928,Reema,Best phone in this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this phone. Everything about it is great. I am not a gamer, and if I were, I would spend more money to buy a phone which had a better chipset. With this price, this phone delivers more than other phones on the market. You have to learn how to use the various features of the camera (which provides amazing shots). Without a doubt the best phone in this price range. I don't know why people are complaing about it."

Camera is decent, macro camera should be improved, but overall camera is good.Battery is sufficient given that this phone has 30w warp charger so battery is not a issue.Overall this phone is pretty good at a pretty great price."
937,Pritha,"Great phone, require some minimal changes considering indian customers...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beast phone in terms of look, design, and oxygen os experience.

950,Rahul Gupta,"Terrible performance, unfit product",1.0 out of 5 stars,   I regret buying this phone.Pathetic touch screen and the screen lagging within the first 2 days was highly unprecedented. Even a phone worth 6K won't hang within first 2 days.Pissed of at Amazon too as they didn't allow the return. Amazon deliberately scheduled a late visit by their expert technician so that the product return time is lapsed.

I cant take any calls in the first go! I always need to call back and only then the call goes through!Google maps doesnt work right on the oneplus and I'm having a really difficult time using Oneplus for basic functionality! Definitely a downgrade for me moving from apple to oneplus

956,Gauthaman,Worth the wait and money....,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Been using it for 2 weeks now.... The battery is good and lasts for a day with moderate usage. There is no display tint issue as said by many users. The camera quality is however a bit low compared to other flagship models.. the colour saturation in camera is low comparatively with my OnePlus 7. But overall it's worth the money. Certain features could improve with updates like camera.

966,MERIN DEV,Network issue..poor connectivity..read before buying,4.0 out of 5 stars,  If you're buying this device keep in mind that it has some network related issues.I had no complaints regarding performance and usage for day to day and even gaming.The only major problem is slow internet speed in OnePlus Nord even though I switched sim card with other phones they were working just fine but not Nord...So my urge is not to buy this phone until OnePlus fix this issue..
967,laxman,Good but costly,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This a very good phone..... It's battery life is good after update ...... And every one knows the oxygen os it's optimization is too good with 765G chip ... It gives very good performance.... About it's camera  it's macro and depth sensors are waste but it's main camera is good and its front camera are really good ...... Overall device is a good product from one plus but slightly costly it's upper midrange phone
968,Er JM Singh,Bad exp. Held with oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not a good choice  ..Not expected from oneplusNo one came to pick up and to replace and not even for service etcJust wasted my time and money this timedon't say return window is closedJustice is due with amazone
969,deva,A successful outcome from 1+,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A standard out put from 1+ which is worth to spend 30k for 12/256gb. I ve enjoyed the features which is realistic as they promoted.  Most of the existing manufacturer are showing their features only in papers where 1+ justifying their best.
970,Roshni Rebecca,NOT A BAD CHOICE. SO FAR SO GOOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:Good displayUser experience is always promised for OP users90Hz is amazingBattery life is goodNo display tint issuesHandy and Easy to holdCons:Average SpeakersAverage cameras at low light
971,Umakant Shukla,Good phone in this price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am little disappointed on battery drainage on standby mode but leave this phone performance is best in my view. I also like it back camera clearity and fast changing mode.I experienced good gaming performance, game like pubg, cod, etcLeave battery drainage problem I had not fased any issues till now.Nice phone in this mid range price but charge high price for 5g support in my point of view."
972,Nishant Redu,Best device in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The best device available in this price rangeGaming is good.I played pubg at high graphics with screen recorder on and it was very smooth experience.Camera is also good.Main thing is the oxygen os.it gives the best experience in this range
973,Davinder Singh,Not even 4G working properly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm facing a strange network error in my OnePlus Nord.

974,Amazon Customer,No option for automatic call record,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  0 starZerooooooNo option for automatic call recordWe can record call manually...we have to record each n every call by pressing record button..but there is voice which says *your call has been recorded"" which can be heard by the receiver alsoPlease come up with some update to resolve this.Without automatic recording...the price value of NORD is 0"
975,Amazon Customer,Battery dries up very fast. Major issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery dries up very very fast. In idle condition when not using the phone and no ternet still it dries up very fast. Believe me, I never faced any issue with my previous phone Oppo F9pro like these. With this phone, if m watching/ chatting the battery dries up like a water. Rectify this or change the handset. I have changed my frequency to 60 ,still no effect.  I have attached few pics for your perusal."
976,Shashank,Amazing Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is one of the best mid-range phones didn't expect anything less from oneplus.
977,Vishwa,Beautiful experience with one plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its awesome. I was very worried what i might receive after reading lot of reviews.

Though I have mentioned my issue in the OnePlus forum there is no response.... disappointing because there isa no audio jack and we are dependent on bluetooth.2. Delivery by Amazon is good.
979,Amarulla.s,Products difeat,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera glass inside dust available
980,GAYATRI DEVI,Value for money purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,   I don't have words for this mobile. This is the King of all under 100k mobiles.30k purchase and features chappar faad.😍😍Battery should be 5000MaH and mobile should be water resistance atleast.Finger print reader is ok.Battery life is goodCamera is quite good.
981,Prashant,Quality Compromised Primium Smartphone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Quality has been Compromised to make it cheaper and it reflects after use within a week. Bluetooth connectivity is hanging, battery drains fast comparative to other smart phone even on 60 Hz display, network comes and goes where there is full network coverage. More to come, as this is my review after one week use."
982,worst,touch screen is very hard,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using nord for a week and i am fully dissatified with the product ....worst touch feel ...average battery. I havent felt a smooth feel while using nord.Its very hard to move my hands while playing games....overall its worst to buy for 28k bucks
983,Abhi,Pathetic,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst experience with an android phone, the most basic feature like automatic call recording is not available. Also when you start a call recording there is a voice notification at both the ends mentioning the 'call recording has started'"

Luckily Amazon accept my return request so I am Returning this product
987,Ramprakash,Excellent peroformance and visual quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everthing seems to be perfect with the phone. The only concern is if you keep 90hz refresh rate and play games with high visual settings, the battery seems to drain pretty quick. And since it does not have 3.5mm jack, using bluetooth headset aslo drastically reduces battery. If connected with type c to 3.5mm connector, it provides excellent battery life"
988,Amazon Customer,Don't expect too much... you will definitely be satisfied with this model for the price you paid,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery back up is approximately 13-16hrs...maximum.Camera is ok not something great not something bad.User interface is best..also 30k model is worth the money.Gaming wise works fine..neither tooo good or bad.Selfie camera is good.But in dark picture calrity is less.Overall a very satisfying phone within budget of 30k.Don't go for lesser storage 64GB. Not worth.

991,NaaG Kosanam,Top in the Worst mobile list.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   12GB + 256 GB Blue variant :1. Lag in updating the photo,which was opened from gallery option in camera.2. Too much beautification in photos those are taken using front camera( I think girls no need to do makeup for taking photos because this phone did it).3. Its better not to talk about Battery performance because its too worst."
992,Titas,Expectations hurt!! But hope for the best,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   Camera quality is not up to the level. However, the main camera is simply wow but the other cameras need further updates. Slow motion video recording is not stable at all, the background light blinks too much! Video uploaded!!

994,Alfred,Best phone for the price........,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing phone for the priceBut improvements could have been made with the macro camara which is is the worst in the phone.For,the 256GB varient the storage is enough without any expandable slots.Afterall it's one plus.........🖤"
995,Hari Nair,"Don't fall for it, 5G is Far Away......",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My OnePlus 6 still feels & performs way better than this Nord. Not worth the price, Disappointed! Try to get a 7T, 8 or 8 Pro by stretching your budget instead. By the time our networks are 5G ready, there will be way better options available than this one."

998,Noman C.,Camera Could have been better,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The way Oneplus Nord was promoted was having all issues resolved from One plus 1 to one plus 8 and camera qualities. But actually scenario is differentPros:Edgy/sharp look and catchy colorhandyRAM and storage capacitySound qualityCons:Front camera is too grainy. After having two camera's also in front, clicked image quality would have been better."

Oneplus' quality  isn't provided in camera .Otherwise for gaming it is good but the camera is the most disappointing thing in the phone . Rear camera is good but the front camera is  really bad .

1001,Deep Rajpal,Do not get carried away with the price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had a 1+ 6 before. I think that was better. If I had a choice to exchange this, I would do it and buy a 1+7t or a 1+8. It's heavy. No doubt the price is attractive. My phone hung 4 times while on a call. The screen quality is poor. U have to be on very high brightness to get the best colors. Battery Life is poor. They need to update a lotof software glitches. I hope they do soon."

If u have skyhigh expectation this is not the phone. Budget oneplus proves again as budget one..."
1005,Amazon Customer,Do Not Go For Nord!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is definitely not upto the mark. I am a OnePlus user from the past 6 years, but OnePlus Nord is a complete disappointment on the basis of a camera, knowing the cameras of OnePlus are too good. Plus, the battery life is not good as expected. I don't play any games on my phone, and yet the battery doesn't last long. I would definitely not recommend this phone for anyone."

1011,saurav,Everything you could ask for.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's everything you could ask for. It's a good daily driver. One plus is known for top service and updates and it's true. They are giving updates for camera and  software which makes the phone a mid range flagship phone.

(Very rare in buget phones)90 Hz display is awesome.Macro and depth camera is waste of money.Front camera videos are not that sharp in artificial lighting. ( 9W LED in room )Pink tint issue when using at night (acceptable, only when you are using in dark mode)"
1021,Dibya Saha,Does a pretty decent job!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Been using this phone for a week now. Pretty premium and lag free experience. The main camera is the real deal and does everything. Other cameras on the rear are pretty much useless. The front cam is decent. The oxygen os is running smooth and the display is great. One downside is the battery. I have to charge the phone multiple times a day. Maybe an update could fix this.
1022,Sushovit Rout,Amazing phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Got this legend delivered to me today on Occasion of Teacher's day. Wanted to gift my dad for his birthday this month.

1026,akshay suresh,New improved Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I got my nord on August 26th since it was a August manufactured unit. I don't see any pink or green tinting issue when brightness is lowered and the phone comes with oxygen OS 10.5.3 out of the box and after updating it to 10.5.5 the screen on time of the phone has drastically improved. According to my preliminary usage  i can say that the Nord is definitely a top phone to consider under 30k.
1027,Wasti,OnePlus Nord is not just Smart it is Super smart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nord is not a flagship phone but it is not lesser then those flagship phones, its camera quality is awsome and battery is very good, fingerprint scanner works fantastically. Graphics are good while playing heavy games, which is due the its processor and OnePlus Oxygen OS. I strongly recommend this phone. This is the one that we want in our pocket."

1037,Parth Patel,Camera quality is very poor.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Speed, display, speaker, battery life is excellent. But camera quality is very poor. Nord have 6 camera set up but not perform very well. I have pixel 2 xl pixel have only one back side, one camera resolution is much batter than Nord 4 back side camera. also with selfie camera. I think company using cheap marketing tactics."

1044,hamdan patel,Awesome phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dual sim phone with speedy operation, good camera. Good battery backup with quick charge. It takes 1 hr for battery to get fully charged."
1045,ejo3132,Average camera performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Indoor camera performance is just average. Not worth this price. I sold the phone ovrr olx snd bought a poco x2. If camera is your first priority,then a BIIIIG NOOOO to NORD. Poco x2 which is almost 10k lesser than the jord gives much better pictures."
1046,Karthik,Classy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A perfect mid ranger with everything made out of oneplus  7 and 8. Better battery, 6 cameras,12 GB ram, better screen, 5G . A perfect touch of everything."
1047,Mayur,Classic Phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I don't know why people are expecting so much flagship features in this price and comparing it with onplus 8 camera. Oneplus Nord is already very well performing.Camera is great.Getting 8 hours of screen on time on normal usage.Screen is extremely smoothOnly con is no 3.5mm jack.......but it's manageable..Don't think twice just go for it.....
1048,Karthikeyan,Somehow astonishing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is absolutely an excellent phone at 30k with 12gb ram and 256gb rom. The fingerprint reader is genuine as top series as 7t,battery life is enough for one day, somehow in case of camera its is elegant and extraordinary in bright light condition but in full and low light condition it is not much as acceptable as a buyer. And at last thanks for oneplus for this astonishing phone.."
1049,Abdul,I highly recommend this device if you're not very particular in getting the best mobile photography.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A solid device for daily usage with smooth performance by oxygen os. I like the oneplus community were you can post suggestions and issues which might get the attention of the developers for improving the device. Camera is decent, obviously not up to flagship standards. All in all an impressive device with premium feel and experience and only slightly lagging wrt camera performance."
1050,Manik,Over hyped,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Frame is plastic... haven't Expected....+ The YouTube reviews are too much over paid... nothing so great about oxygen OS and nord itself. The camera cut out sucks...it kills content. + I hate the way the upper part darkens while gameplay

1052,!,Best phone of 2020 in 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Bloody good product!!One plus has finally understood that the sub 30k is the sweet spot for them. People prefer Samsung and Apple for anything that's over 40-50kI bought 3T 3+ years back and it worked like a charm. Nord is same price range and definitely a best buy in Sep 2020 for 30k
1053,Souvik,One of the best overall midsegment smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well , it is what it is , a midsegment smartphone and it definitely has some setbacks like the 2 useless cameras on the back and the stereo speakers are not there which is kind of true for most of the smartphones in this range and it is like the norm for the midtier smartphone. Hence I would say this is one of the best overall midsegment smartphone."

Just for streaming 1 or 2 movies.If it is 90hz it only gives you 10 max but if you switch to 60hz it gives you 12hrs. Battery is not performing like they promised. Camera is good but not as good as earlier phones. Overall first impression is good except battery.

Otherwise overall a good phone at this price."
1118,Aniket Y.,Just perfect for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It looks more premium in person! Everything sums up so perfectly, the 90 hz display makes it feel smooth!

Those who want a good os experience also can consider this.It is the entry of oxygen os.
1121,Vishnu,Display tint a new feature,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dont fall in trap. According to one plus, this phone has a new feature ""pink tint in display"" after knowing that it was a feature, I was so grateful.

1128,Komal,Buy 7t instead if you want a OnePlus.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Below average image quality. Selfies come with a halo around the head. Looks photopshopped. Disappointment! Do not buy if you want even a decent camera. Phones in half the price are offering better cameras as per my personal experience.

The probmem is with the ear phone as only bluetooth version can be used and that has to be bought separately which costs another 5000 rs. Exorbitant rate for a ear phone."

1446,Prasad,Most overhyped phone of 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,  People who like dark themes should beware that OnePlus Nord has tint issues. I thought it wouldn't be a big problem but it definitely looks something like a damaged product in low brightness. The overall specs are decent but for a phone this price one should not expect any display issues.
1447,Anonymous,Worst thing in Oneplus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bad thing about oneplus nord is that when you wants to record someone's call , it will say your call will be recorded. The other person will come to know that you will be recording the call.I advice oneplus to bring latest update and remove this automatic call recording message."
1448,AKHIL,Decent mid range phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is pretty decent look wise. Battery drains slightly faster and to prolong battery life one has to keep it in battery saver mode most of the time. Camera works good except for low light photo.

4640,Aman More,A good daily driver.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera."
4641,Abhishek Agarwal,Bad bad camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review."
4642,Kiran KS,The original segment of One Plus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok...."
4643,Nikhil,*Read before you buy!!*,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)"
4644,Deblina Roy,Disappointing,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved."
4645,Amit,Near to mid range  Perfection,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD"
4646,Sreeram,Totally dissatisfied. No AR support.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time."
4647,aishwarya,Great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time."
4648,Sudeshna Dey,Bad front camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good."
4649,Rahul,Good phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  ProSmooth OS - no lags at allAMOLED screen is good quality screenPrivacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesAll other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviationsConNot a metal frameCPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read  some users sharing the green tint issue.  I did not face that yet.  Will update reviews in case of any issues.
