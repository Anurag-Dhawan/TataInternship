0,vasu a.,Beast in OnePlus.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Brilliant..I have uploaded some pics of selfie as well as Portrait shot of near by shot.What is loved is phone has very good sensor.It's my first phone after my job so it's really special for me.Fine Screen..Smooth touch..Camera is beast. Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it."
1,Amazon Customer,OnePlus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the  I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.
2,ATMANAND  SHARMA,Khoda pahad nikli chuihya,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Average phone from one plus but surprisingly very bad battery life though good battery on paper. Disappointed .
3,Amazon Customer,One plus Nord issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.
4,ARYA,'More than midrange but less than premium '.  This phone has heating issues...😥,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks"
5,Sibasish Raulo,Preorder customers were scammed,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I have nothing to say about this product but marketing strategy. While pre-ordering this product there was no hdfc bank creditcard offer so I have to purchase it by paying full amount. But after delivery it is showing hdfc credit card discount is applicable for 12gb + 256gb variant. This is ridiculous. There's not even return option for this product. This is not at all fair to the customer who pre-ordered this product. And OnePlus and Amazon is just breaking their trust.
6,Dinesh Kumar,Bed battery,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true
7,rishabh,"cheap camera, overpriced phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars,  don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.
8,Nitin Mittal,Empty mobile box with all.missomg contents was delivered,1.0 out of 5 stars,   Stop cheating customers by arranging a tempered delivery with only an empty mobile box. It's my hard earned money and the Amazon investigation team is refuting all claims.I have enough evidences to prove my claim of tempered delivery and will escalate the matter to the highest level and will also drag Amazon India on all social media besides suing them.in Consumer court.
9,Amazon Customer,Changed to Nord from 6t,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days."
10,Akhil,Best in it's range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.Update- The bug was fixed on the same day."
11,Saikrishna,Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied"
12,Imran Khan,Packing was not good. Overall disappointed with product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.---------++++------After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi"
13,Bhanu,I don't like this.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First look is cool.But too much weight.Not easy in use.When you open some web page or other app ,you want to go back there is not easy option to go back.12gb ram is wasted because it's working like 6gb ram mobile.My heart saying that I return this product."
14,Manmohan Singh Tanwar,Auto call recorder not available,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Where is call recording option
15,Nidhin Cherian,For camera enthusiasts,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dear camera enthusiasts,Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera2. Lacks in sharp and crisp outputBetter go for OnePlus 7T"
16,pavan,"This is my initial impression after using OnePlus nord for few hours, as I received today",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was opted for exchange with my RedMi note 7 pro to purchase OnePlus nord 8GB modal.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Bloatware free and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro’s:• OxygenOS – gives very good user experience than other android mobiles.• 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display• Camera’s – image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera, nightscape, slow motion video and front camera• Stable video recording – with Optical and electronic image stabilization• Supports 5G network – I am not sure when it is going to be launched in India (may be in 2021.?)• Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – supports 5G network with midrange performance (excellent for daily usage)Cons:• Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output• Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBGI don’t find more cons as of nowColor tint issue?Not found in my mobile, while screen light dims less than 20%.If your priority is not gaming, this could be considerable option."
17,Amit,"Amazing phone, damaged packaging.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone 5/5Phone is fantastic, everything as expected.But the box was open. No seal on box. Though items are fine inside but might be duplicate as well. This is not a good exp for a prebooked phone.Box1/5"
18,aamir khan,Not satisfied,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really very disappointed with the performance, as battery is not so good, charging time is too late as given by the company, device display quality is also not good"
19,Anand,Oneplus has returned in its own market with a worthy product.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  First of all I wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as I want to gift it to my sister.Oneplus is a no match in this range.  You should go for this without any doubt.Except poor camera quality eveything is superb. Snapdragon 765G is fast and 90Hz display is superb. I am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported.One more low point is that it does not feel  premium as its side is made of plastic.Go for it without any second thought.I will edit my review after some days of use.
20,Savan,First And Worst Experience With OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Received A Faulty Device As First Only And Received The phone Where Speaker Was Not Working...
21,Sahil kalsi,Worth every penny & please don't buy Oppo Reno 4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming."
22,Abhishek,OnePlus NORD detailed review.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ...I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit ..I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons .Pros-1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent.2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good.3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone.4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate.5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie.6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone .7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price.Cons.1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865.2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion.3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this.Personal Opinion.Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.If you find this review helpful please consider to like this review"
23,shristi bhatt,Super hit,5.0 out of 5 stars,  In love with the camera quality and the color of the phone. Works smoothly. Impressed!!Also online sale is on 4th and I got it today (on 2nd). Swift delivery.
24,Dharanidharan.S.P,No issues and great phone with medium camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY."
25,SHYAM SINGH,Its a good set,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I always want a oneplus mobile now I have one it's a good mobile
26,Sai Kumar Thota,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Waste of money , Not at all satisfied ,poor camera quality , poor product quality. Better to buy Redmi mobile ..."
27,saisathvik,WORTH THE BUCKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,  First things first I'm very impressed by the AMAZON delivery services.Coming to NORD It got all the hype. Easily recommendable if you use it as a regular phone for social media and business purpose. It is not so great for gamers. So think before you buy it and compare all the other options too.Last things last overall performance is very fast and enjoying the OXYGEN OS.
28,Chaitali,One plus and plus...NORD !,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now! My wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus :-)"
29,Sachin Jawade,Unexpected Delivery 🤘,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's delivered today (3rd August)Branding level improved.Some sticker in box.Mobile is lite weight.Color is extremely premium.Screen quality same as 7T.Let's wait for detail feedback hope it will good 👻💕
30,Jijo Paul,"Decent Mobile, but Genuinely Overhyped..",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!"
31,Rajamurugan L,How is it oneplus nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very bad experience don't buy this product, the mobile display lighting very dull compare with redmi Mobile's and mobile over heating and camera quality very worst, don't buy this product. If you want this mobile please reach out nearby oneplus showroom and use this mobile and if you satisfied then you buy this product. I'm very unsatisfied this product 😔😔😔😔😔"
32,Subhodeep Ghosh,Selfie camera is south. Rest everything goes north.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the worst front cameras in recent days. Apart from that, it's a deal at this price."
33,Ashish,Amazing beast from OnePlus!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!"
34,Hemendra R.,OnePlus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just received OnePlus Nord grey 256 gb variant and trust me guys it is just amazing,worth every rupees."
35,Ayush,Display issues and Delay in delivery,1.0 out of 5 stars,  1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon.
36,Ritesh S Rao,"Its a good product, just a little costly",4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone received today. Bought it for my mother. She seems to like it a lot. Software experience as expected is very smooth. No lags faced. Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad). The battery life is good (2 hrs of video and browsing and loss of ~11% battery) so expect it to last all day for sure.
37,Azhar javed,Bad phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  A bad phone Asked to return Refused to return No such phone is mentioned feeling bad
38,Prajwal,Premium buget....not flagship,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly a lot of reviews are towards the camera..... of course it's not flagship, for the price you're paying it's well worth it for a balanced experience......you can't expect it to be flagship in all levels.....if you want then buy a specific phone catered to that like rog for gaming.etc-Smooth fluidic screen movements-Fast performance 12gb ram-Decent camera with 4k feature-Speaker volume is loud and sound is clear"
39,Jackie Thakkar,Bad phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not value for money, you are spending 30K for one plus phone but they not providing same to u. For same feature you will get in 22K phone. Only plus point is in one plus is this is 5G ready and 12Gb 256 storage phone.I have shared some pictures of Oneplus and same i have click from 18K phone Real me 6 pro. And i feel Real Realme bttr phone compair to Oneplus."
40,Nirmit kapoor,Best in class,5.0 out of 5 stars,  First i was confused as review by Youtubers. But i can say this is best phone in this segment OnePlus oxygen OS is dam smooth with simple and clean UI.. Camera works excellent and don't go with hype of blue marble it look like realme types.. Grey color looks like Flagship OnePlus .. 50 minutes Full charging ... PUBG is working good ping is also decent while playing...
41,Harish T,Worst Experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display itself not working!!  Did not expect this from oneplus !!!!How did it pass QA and delivered to customer if the display itself not turning on ?????I got my mobile through pre booking and returned it. When i asked about replacement, they said there is no replacement stock eventhough regular stocks are on sale. Worst mobile buying experience ever !!!!!!!!!!"
42,Hardeep Singh,Smooth performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like that phone very much. It is smooth , good audio and video. I missed one thing here is no audio jack. Today is day one will update our review in 1-2 weeks.Day 26 here is my review . Phone is super smooth . first week I feel battery is dying to fast but there is an software which is now fixed with update now I am getting full day battery backup. I play pubg alot with no lags and frame drop. There is no issue with display like other people are saying about nord. My experience is awesome with this phone."

44,The wanderer,Review after using the mobile for one week,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure."
45,Atanu Mandal,Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My Nord Journey with Amazon:-15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499.18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers.28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999.05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start.Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon.** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone.Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use.Pros :✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10.✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back.(U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality).✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate.✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography.✓ Duel selfie camera.✓ Light weight and easy to grip.✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates.✓ Battery backup is quite good.✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment.✓ Both Sim working fine.✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z.

Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case.✓No Dolby Atmos.✓No 3.5 mm jack.## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro..."
46,Debraj Das,Worst camera even though having 4 of them,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got the mobile..1st impression - minimal design, no useless app, got the os update... But ! The camera ! Not statisfied.. currently I'm using Poco F1.. even though the Nord has quad rear cam with latest sensor, but the images are too grainy.. my Poco F1 produces much more better image..This is within 2hours review after having the product.. I'll update further after using it sometimes.."
47,Chetanya,Bugs,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice phone but the green tint issue is very noticeable on 50 percente brightness and is annoying the why 2 stars. Rest of good. Also photos in artificial light give a very pale colour to skin
48,Sudhir Babu G,Regarding camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are buying for camera, then my suggestion is don't buy this phone because compared to one plus 6, photos are getting blured in Nord."
49,Prudhvi,Display color leak,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pre ordered and waited like anything... Arrived on time. Everything is fantastic in Nord except Display color leak or I don't know what to call it. I shared images and videos, go through it. Why why why faulty products?"
50,suman saurabh ghosh,"heating issues , Battery draining !! NO return policy for defective product.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  While charging, Video calling , simple Net browsing (separately)There is no Return/Replace policy for defective products as inspection guy says Amazon will fetch money from his pocket if he allows replacement and amazon is not satisfied with the issue...So indirectly no one will take risk to approve these internal issue as they are afraid what if amazon doesnt get satisfied .. like how i was not able to satisfy the inspection guy.. its all about inspection guys wish .. if he wants then only your issue will get resolved ..else you have to live with the defective product."
51,Saherr,Please return money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst phone
52,Nensee Kaneriya,Display issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display tint issue in my modelAmazon refused to replace my phone.
53,Ayanik Dey,Very very disappointed with amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I was totally devastated after i received the product as it was a defective one. Its getting hanged and switched off multiple times automatically. And after all these stuff i dont kno whether my product will be replaced. Very very  poor from amazon.
54,ayush joshi,This phone is just amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)"
55,Sasank P,Absolutely recommend this phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Almost everything you get under 30k price range... Oxygen OS is the best android skin right now... Experiencing it under 30k is a deal breaker...There are other smartphones with Snapdragon 800 series processors under 30k.. but not all of them are bloatware free except OnePlus...Buy this phone if you love to have a nice UI, great display, good camerasAbsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under 30kProvding a headphone jack to type-c  would have been very good"
56,Abhijeet Anand,An honest an Fair review after using it for a while.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-•OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.•The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.•The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)•The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)•The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.•The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-•The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.•After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone"
57,Rahul,Balanced Device,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using it for several days,I noticed some issues1) Image processing is taking time(more than usual)2) After clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while, otherwise the image will get blurred3) Low light photography is very poor4) Battery is draining faster even in 60Hz refresh rate.5) Sometimes networks drops are there, you'll lost internet connection for seconds and it'll restore after it.But all of these issues can be resolved by update and OnePlus is very concerned about their customers,as they keeps asking for issues in their community page.Buy it if you're not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device."
58,SHIVAM AGARWALA,BAD EXPERIENCE,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Poor display ... .. also vibration slider not working properly ....Bad experience.. OP
59,Dilbagh Singh,Not good,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is ok but some drawback..
60,surya prakash,Very bad performance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very very bad performance , i upgrade to my mi a1 that was brilliant Mobile the one plus Nord is bad performance and camera fully unclear photos front and rear camera also"
61,Ravi Kumar,Very bad as expected,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst product
62,Mani Shankar,If you care about what the phone is than the specs...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.
63,Rahul,Nothing great about this mobile,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media.  The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just  mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.Felt so damn cheated.To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it."
64,Sandeep rana,Not good Colur,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bed product and performance no return policy not happy to this product
65,Amazon Customer,After 3 days usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out."
66,Sunil,Severe display issue (over brightened and green tint),1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have got severe display issue with green tint on 75% of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side. No matter how good the phone is in other features but it's being a mid range premium phone, at least this issue not expected.I have ordered 2 phones in which 1 phone is completely alright (no display issue) and other has severe. I tried to exchange the product but Amazon is not supporting for the same.EDIT : Thanks to Amazon for processing the return with refund. (Replacement could not be processed as the product is unavailable)"
67,Harshita,Not happy with the product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Returning window of this product is closed on 30-Aug and same day I started receiving problem in keyboard.Keyboard of Nord is crashing and I reached out to One Plus support team as well, ticket is open now n yet to be solved.But it is very disappointing to receive problem in newly bought product.After a bit research I found keyboard problem is occured in many of earlier One Plus mobiles. Battery is also draining within a day. 100% charged battery doesn't last for 2 days even.Recommend all the upcoming buyers to check their mobile as early as they can; specially the keyboard thing; within the returnable timeframe.My experience started with a sad note :("

71,Mohammed Ismail,Waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very exciting to buy this mobile. But later realized that it's not worth the money.Pros:*Oxygen OS*90hz refreshing display*Smooth operationCons:Poor battery backupUnexpected poor cameraLess color variantsBottomline: Expected much better product especially camera and battery but it lags both. Realme X2 pro is better option than this.Updated:It's a total waste off money, pls don't buy it, lot of issues are there in mobile.Calls are not hearing properly most of the time.Battery backup is very very poorCamera is totally awful, it's like 10000rs mobile, not worth for 30K."
72,Dattej Naik,Total disappointment with product and services,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Im a one plus user for past few years and this is the worst product iv seen.. the pros of this is its vibrant colour and price..Cons. Had problem with fingerprint sensor, its not water proof. As after 15 days of use moisture started forming inside both the camera lens.So i tried to aproach one plus customer care for conrinuous 3 days and it was so hectic stil they cudnt connect me to any customer executive of theirs. Then i aproached the customer care of one plus near me.. i.e. in mapusa goa. They said tht one plis is not providing them any support so they have shut down al the services temporarily.This is the first time i faced so much issues with the phone and one plus services..The only option left now is to throw this phone into garbage.. and go for some other phone .Totaly disapointed."
73,Ronit,Defective product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Tint issue.The dnd slider is malfunctioning.
74,GP,Screen has bands/strips of green and pink,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Generally i don't write negative feedback. But this phone really has screen issue. The screen reflects in bands of green and pink. This is mainly visible in white backgrounds. It stains eyes. What you return this phone.
75,SDanda,"Awesome processor power, Touch feel and Front Camera Quality",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models."
76,Parimal Chaudhari,Amazon User,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's best product...OnePlus is a brand and...Nord is a new direction...camera quality is better but not as good as 8...and battery life is quite good and it's charges 40 min 0 to 100....it gaves the best performance....and here is 90hrtz refresh rate then it's best but...if u used 60htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference... Face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good...and AMOLED display is the best... U must need to but this product....and now new direction comes in my life I m happy to get it..😋😋
77,Shalu Shaji,Descent phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I am writing this review after 1 day of use. First of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between 65-75 minutes.Camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography.Low light photography is the place we need to improve I believe.Sometimes I think this phone is overpriced but the Oxygen OS experience will remove that thinking from our mind.
78,Yaswanth S.,Well balanced package at a price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G."
79,Ryanrazor1911,Great Phone for works great.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone is perfect for someone who uses it for casual use like facebook WhatsApp and some games and other apps and nothing intensive and with some pictures here and there..Built wise: 8/10Camera: 7/10Speakers 7/10Display 9/10 (mine had no tint issue)Battery 6/10 could be optimised with updateSo if you are not a very heavy user than just go for it..phone feels very good in hand with a perfect weight balance... although pubg runs fine with smooth ultra but I played only 1 TDM XD.
80,arun,Disappointed with OnePlus cheep publicity tricks,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mobile overall ok, but I'm really disappointed with OnePlus cheep publishing stunts for both budget tv and phone, that's the reason for one star review. Camara is flicking when we take vedios of fire/ smoke, I took videos/pics on house warming all of them I took while yagnam were flicking and blure, OnePlus connect is not so usefull with the OnePlus TV, keyboard not opening, when we play vedio audio and video are nonsync. Front cam also not soo good, I like the fingrt print point and switch. They could have give option to the user for wired headset, cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours, don't think soo wireless ones will serve purpose."
81,Sanan Kamthe,A perfect smartphone for all of my needs!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!
82,Kindle Customer,A Midrange Phone With Best Camera Possible + Oxygen Os,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought the OnePlus phone first time and I bought12gb 256gb varient of this phone..I like every things on this smartphone like 5g ready, camera, oxygen os, performance is mediocore.The Software of this device is best in the game. I like it because it has the functionality like stock Android and also highly customisable. You can get software updates very quickly and fastly. It's 90hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy.I actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me. It's camera have OIS supported , you can get very good daytime shots with it. And may be mediocore night time shots But not as the level of flagship but this doesn't bother me because with the power of Lightroom I can bring those photos to the another level.The two things I didn't like that it's battery life it could be little bit better and also. It's display have some little tint issue.But that's not a big problem for me.Below are the attached sample shots from this device."
83,Jas,A daily driver,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star."
84,Chinmayee Mishra,"A delightful device, held back by quality control",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it."
85,SourabhHalder007,A phone and brand you can trust!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone got delivered today, it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder. I bought this phone for my father and playing around with it I guess this would be the best option for him. He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks. Macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of.NOTE: Heavy Gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term.Thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion, a good strategy must say."

87,Arki,Serious issues with Bluetooth connectivity (solved with updates),4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well what do you know, after much anticipation, I finally received my oneplus nord. thanks to amazon for striving to deliver even during these trying times.without much further ado lets get down to the nitty-gritty as am not much into writing reviews.First of all gave only three stars as it is kinda hit and miss.> Battery is ok with average usage but heavy users will be disappointed... wrap charge does a wonderful job as described and charges the device really fast.>Camera is so so .... 48 mp takes good shots but that's about it as the rest is average at best ..macro is the worst.>Finger print scanner and face unlock works just fine.>Had no issues with display. videos are crisp... youtube and netflix videos especially hdr contents are a joy to watch.> wifi and internet connectivity is good especiall with dual connect.>Microphone quality is ok and cell reception is also good.Thats the ok part ... now comes some of the bad part> As in the headlines there are some serious issues with bluetooth connectivity, All bluetooth devices you name it... fit bit, audio etc etc  gets disconneted frequently as well as sometimes it is a pain to pair sometimes not pairing at all, have tried the bluetooth devices in other phones and laptop and they work just fine.. why am I making this a big thing...... because one plus did not include a headphone jack period and i love listening to music!!!! i dont know whether this is a software or hardware issue ... have installed the latest updates so will have to wait for the next update to know whether it will get corrected or not.>The speakers on the phone are mediocrewill update after using it for a month or so (hopefully my impression of the device will change... keeping fingers crossed)Now you choose whether to buy or not as there are other good phones out there.>overall performance is good (not excellent)Update:Bluetooth issues solved with updates, amazed at OnePlus frequent updates, camera performing much better now, have been using the phone for about a month now.4 stars"
88,MVK,No issues any more as we heard...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All rumours like green tint , display issue at low light condition , battery backup is less , takes more time to charge were absolutely WRONG.OnePlus lovers can go for it without any second thought.Tested almost 10days to give exact review...Display is good., 90Hz refresh rate is awesome, no tint issue at all brighness levels, loudness of speaker is good (no stereo), charges less than an hour(warp charging), good battery backup almost a day (without gaming) .Only issue I faced is with OnePlus z series bluetooth headset gets disconnected in between calls and audio playback. Hope this will also resolve soon."
89,Rahul Banga,OnePlus Nord turned out to be a dudd!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry."
90,Roopa C N,The best phone (for the price),5.0 out of 5 stars,  An awesome phone for the price. Simply great. The camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos. If you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto 30k go for it. No other brand gives you a 12|256 variant for this price. The phone is awesome. You wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using.
91,karanjit k.,camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The front camera is pathetic, blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures, its not worth giving 28k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone. For front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad, sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality. i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it, or they just want to bluff the customer by name......... u can get more good camera phone in this rangeRear camera is good, macro is pathetic its like vga camera, in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality, you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos.Battery drains too quicklySoftware is good"
92,Ganesh Vishwakarma,"Bad camera, overall good!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is good but few things disappointed me. Please see the following matrix given below:1. Build quality: 4.5/5 ( it does not have the metal frame)2. Display: 4/5 ( compared with samsung j6 AMOLED display, it is not up to the mark, i liked the Samsung's display because of color reproduction and quality)3. Battery: 4/54. Operating System: 5/55. Camera: 2.5/5 ( eventhough it has 48 MP with Quad Cam setup, pictures are not detailed, it a average camera even after the software update; specially 2MP macro lens sucks; video quality is very nice; camera app user experience is not exciting.6. Processor: 4/5 (because its futuristic 5G)"
93,guddu kumar,Speaker volume goes down day by day automatically.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  When the phone was delivered it’s sound looks good.But after a days it’s speaker volume automatically goes low .And day by day it’s going low and low.Even on handsfree mode on full volume I have to take it to close to my ear to hear it.I want to replace it but amazon not allowing for replacement.I am totally frustrated after buy this phone.
94,Kamal,Doesn't go with the price tag,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its been one month approx of purchasing this device in which OnePlus has given 5 updates so here is my review after one month usage and on latest update1) the mobile is full of bugs, it looks like oneplus team didn't tested it before launching . A lot of bugs like camera crashing, photos not showing in gallery ,overheating after only 25min streaming,night mode error . already shared logs with the OnePlus team no fix as of now even after 5 updates still the same problems2)  on an average only 5 hours of screen on time, doesn't look like 4000mah battery have to charge twice during a day ,my older redmi Mobile was giving better SOT than this3)  network drops issue most often chrome shows blank page have to reload 3-4 times to show the page content4) the oxygen os is good smooth as silk5) camera performance is average6) amoled display surely surpasses lcd ,great colors diversification Conclusion- being new member to OnePlus community i expected premium services didn't expect such a buggy device"
95,Ayyappan,No Tint issue ... It's been fixed 😊👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  NO TINT ISSUEI TURNED ONT HE PHONE THEY GAVE ME AN UPDATE...SO typically your phone brightness level0 - 100 levelthey palyed it smart .. they removed 0--50 levelsSo technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to 0.. well it's actually 50th level portraying as 0 .. My First costly Smart phone.Well.. For average person I mostly invest under 15k for a smart phone.. Now I'm in work from home and I need a phone which has a fast performance to toggle between apps for my communication / multitasking without any lagging or unwanted adds... And ya bla bla people who worship camera as if they are Ravi varmans cousin's...  Guys this phone is literally a mustang coated in Ferrari dust...*Hard build even though claims to be plastic body* A devil Performance which u can expect from no  Android phone.* Yes fast charging helps us stay alive.*It has a open ""allow access"" system which I like so that I can monitor which app is using my phone tools..* When smart phone concept came to the marked I started with Samsung Galaxy pop moved to Moto G then redmi 4 ... Now it's NORD...I bought it @ 25k by exchanging my redmi 4.. a decent buy for me.Rating:Back camera:5/5Front camera:4/5 because pics look slightly animatedPerformance: 5/5Battery:4/5 you can expext 6-7hrs max.. but fast charging helps u in 30-45mins charge sets full battery..Design: 5/5Durability : No IP certification so try to avoid water drops and dust touching the device.People buying this in Chennai .. remember only one service center available... Tnagar..I recommend you to use the back case given buy them ..it's durabale."
96,Sangeeth,Best smartphone under 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have used it for about a week and I will have to tell that it's the Best allround smartphone under 30k. You are getting future ready with a 5g smartphone and Brand Recognition of One plus.Pros1) Oxygen OS2) 90Hz Amoled screen3) Smooth performance4) Good Battery Life5) Fast ChargingThere are not many cons according to me. The only one I which i noticed is that Rear camera quality isn't that great compared to Oneplus 8 like they are claiming. But they are good in Ample lighting conditions. Only when it comes to Indoor and low light they struggle a bit.Verdict- Go for it. It's a perfectely well balanced phone covering every aspects. The beauty of OXYGEN OS and Brand Recognition of ONE PLUS are something that you can't ignore.
97,Padma,Very horrible phone  a big no 👎,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Very worst phone don't buy.Iam facing network connection issues.while talking it is going into hold n recording starts automatically . whatsapp call not at all responding very very worst phone after few updates iam facing these problems ...one month after iam giving my feedback don't buy this phone waste of money ..
98,Arjun goyal,Combines lot of good elements in one affordable package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don’t mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You’d be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback... So if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than 30k then just go for it"
99,Shubham,Not recommend,3.0 out of 5 stars,  * Packing - Soft (Amazon)* Price - 25999 (AE Discount)* Touch - very smooth* Camera - front not good very disappointed by OnePlusBack - need improvement like filters and autofocus* Have some bugs* Purchase advise - Think again

101,Adnan Ali,My honest review,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all I'm writing this review after 3-4 days of use. 1.The display is indeed a bliss to look at. You may not notice it at first. But you'll see other phones in slow motion when you use other phones.2.The warp charging is amazing. Gets your phone filled in under an hour.3.The primary camera is nice and captures details but it lacks the natural colour reproduction at times and the dynamic range needs to be better.(the camera of the redmi k20 pro is slightly better in terms of the color reproduction) and iphone xr camera still is better4.The macro camera is bullshit and need updates right away.5. Wide angle lens is okay, just okay.needs betterment. And could be better.6.The selfie camera is fine but no iphone camera , the wide angle selfie isn't that nice7.the build quality is firm,nice and of nice built but stands a tad bit lower from the redmi k20 pro ,maybe because of the metal frame vs plastic in Nord.8.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is damn fast.9. The battery lasts for a day under moderate use. Not more than a day for sure.10.Oxygen OS ! Wow . Just smooth, fast and a bliss !"
102,Vivek,Nord is good but need to develop camera quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I had used my oneplus nord for 3hoursPros1.regarding display display was really cool with 90refresh rate and smooth2. Oxygen os is love3.I didn't find any greentits issues in my oneplus nors4.battery i was charged to 100% within 35mins where inital charges was 51% fast charging5.Audio clarity really good and no lagging and no network issues foundCons1.avg of camera quality and nightspace and bad not perfect2.this mobile is not for gaming they are really better choice rather than thisOverallIf your are daily user without gaming it is good
103,Amazon Customer,Good phone for day to day usage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display/Touch is really good.Battery Life is also good for normal users like me, who use 3-4 hrs screen time in a day.. I am easily able to draw 40-42 hrs with a full charge.Camera is good..though it can be improved.Real quick charging.Fingerprint reader is fast, with lots of customization.You will see lot of new features when you switch from an android phone like - App drawer, hidden apps, wifi+ mobile data mode etc.."
104,Anupama,Overall a really good phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been us this phone for a week now and here is my review.The build quality is quite good but I don’t like the plastic frame but feels durable enough.Look wise the phone is gorgeous and eye catchy I loved its look and in-hand feel.The rear camera is quite nice for the wide angle camera struggles in low light and the selfie camera is only good in well lighted conditions and is useless at night or even little dark. I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won’t notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements
105,Tejas Ravindra Haramkar,"Cool, neat and clean, smooth....",5.0 out of 5 stars,  Thank you OnePlus and Amazon... Product delivery is very fast.. I am first time using OnePlus device....but I love it...😘😘😘
106,Nishant Rajkumar,Worst Product experience of my life!! BUYERS BEWARE,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had ordered a OnePlus Nord from Amazon on 6th of August. It was delivered on 8th of August. After using it for a week the display was distorted. I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution. I will never buy a OnePlus device ever again till I exist."
107,Amazon Customer,very poor camera and call issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  what happened to oneplus. It used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x. now we no longer can trust specs on paper.selfie camera is one of the worst ever. blurry pixelated images. 3 yrs old phone models in this range have better camera. even making calls have issues with this phone. there are bugs everywhere.very poor quality in ever aspect. total waste of money. they have to understand, they cant please everyone. End of the quality matters and there should be value for money spent and specs needs to be up to the industry standard. just saying 32 MP is not enough, if it performs equivalent to 5MP.this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money."
108,ChatakonduYaswanth,Not recommended please........,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Just ok mobile there are lot more defects but manageable for normal users my suggestion to go with other brand's in this price# Black bar in night mode at top if display# Screen tint issue pucca# No Battery backup# Worst cam no use of back 2 cameras# No full screen mode for applications# No 3.5 Jack# Out of the box RAM 4gb/8gb# Sound us loud but no clear# Original accessories are so costly# More baground cached data# Sometimes lagging..Overall my rating is 4/10 please check all YouTube pros and cons before you buy don't buy in hurry like me.
109,Saif Alam Khan,Great phone by OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Premium looking phone with a clean and smooth UI. With regular and faster updates by OP, it's certainly the best phone in this price range."
110,Suganraj,Never settle - Too Many  issues to be settled with Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  #Camera Quality is not up to the mark when compared to  previous OnePlus previous models and generates lots of noise.#Bugs were there when I did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of 4K@60 fps and it got resolved once I updated to the latest OS version.#Green & Purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below 30% brightness.#People who prefer 6GB + 64 GB variant must keep in mind that OnePlus Nord does not have an expandable memory slot. So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue."
111,Priya Kumar,Didn’t expect this from ONEPLUS,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finger print reader is too slow and asking me to keep my fingers for more time than other phones.. battery life I have no idea.. I haven’t started using it fully,. Camer quality.. sorry there is no quality at all.. too much of beautification In the front camera and back camera too.. I can’t even make a video call using this because I don’t look like me in the front camera.. am really really disappointed.. am using iPhone 7+ should have gone for iphone 11.. I did a big mistake.. since it’s not refundable I have to live with the regret 💔 until I upgrade next.. thanks n bye"
112,Shishir,Excellent purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After using 3 years the battery of my  moto x4 is suddenly stopped working after an ota update .... battery replacement was not possible during lockdown ....at the same time one plus announced to release a midrange smartphone like zlite ....one plus brand has great customer satisfaction regarding oxygen os optimization on hardware  ..so I decided to purchase oneplus nord (later declared) with preorder benefits ....blindly purchase Rs 499 ... enjoyed AR launched event ..got my preorder box1  tshirt and stickers...booked nord @Rs 26k using amex card ..my pre-order is being delayed ..again oneplus announced that they will provide one year extra warrenty to those whose pre-order shiioed after 4aug ..mine shipped on 10 aug ... delivered on 11 aug ....also they also provide my box 2 @Rs4780 and provide one year extra warrenty as they promised.. so at last faith on oneplus regarding products offers is totally worthy...in this way effective price of my nord is 19620 [28k - 2k (amex offer) - 4780( gift box) -1599( one year extended warranty)].Right now I have updated my nord to 10.5.5 ..I didn't face any problem just one google discover issue which may be issue with Google dearch to higher refresh rate display ...No Bluetooth issueNo battery backup issue (since I am not a gamer)Fabulous display with 90hzFast 30 watt charger765G  ...5G readyBut have slightly tint screen issue (using dark theme and very low brightness)Camera is overhyped...may be optimised after ota update...Battery backup not at the best..
113,Amazon Customer,"Great midrange '5G' phone, performance at par with Flagships!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Read this review before buying OnePlus Nord!!!Review after using the phone for 9 days!Pro's:-1. Oxygen Os best os after 'ios'!2. Display is good! (Fluid Amoled 90hz)3. The speaker is loud and clear!4. Alert slider comes in handy!5. The phone is really good to hold!6. Warp charger!7. Future proof with '5g'8. Updates9. The camera quality is good both front and back after the update!10. Battery life is good for non-gamers!11. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock works really well!!Con's:-1. Amazon's delivery got the phone delivered after 2 weeks!2. No headphone jack,but understandable given that tws is the future!!3. Tint issue though not a major problem but can be seen in dark conditions!The phone is good, but I would advise you to wait for Realme x7 pro and Poco's nord killer, compare them with Nord before you take your decision!!Have a good day!!!😄"
114,B.Kumar,Nice 5 g phone in reasonable price in this segment,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice 5g phonePros -5 stars for battery, voice, sound.5 stars for screen colours and touch etc.4 stars for camera being limited features.Cons -1. During updates screen looks whole black, like something wrong with phone screen.2. No sd card provision.Cautions -Do not use backside transparent guards for this mobile as all guards available are flat but mobile is slightly curved from margins. So do not waste your money on backside guards.Overall -Nice mobile , Go for it"
115,SkReddy,OnePuls Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got mobile yesterday with pre-booking facility on Amazon,Super mobile with Flagship mobile specifications under 30000..1.Google dailer2.Battery3.camera4 OnePlus Brand"
116,Harry John,Absolute Gem....,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had been a critic of one plus and it's users so far, but now realised why one plus users are so mad about their phones...till now I had used motorola, Sony and Samsung phones....never experienced the smoothness and speed like one plus....battery back up is absolutely good using it from 100% (8 pm to 9 am ) and had done all installing process, video and movie watching, still have 40% left.... absolutely stylish mobile, the blue colour  is damn attractive....I am not a gamer so have no idea in that side.... everybody had lot of praising for os....have to experience it and feel the smoothness....the only down side in this mobile is the large cut out for front camera, too big and one camera would be more than enough, it had also reduced the beauty of the phone....I had switched from Samsung A51 ( used it for less than 15 days), compared to Samsung the camera is far ahead....no colour tinting issue(worried a lot about it after ordering)....one more thing if u r using the case coming with the mobile be ready for a very bad smell from the case...my conclusion is blindly go for it, you will never regret....value for money...."
117,McK,Value for money mid ranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great battery life- I have consistently been getting a full day’s use on a single charge, even 36hrs on one occasion where I used it sparingly. And the battery charges 15% to 100% in under an hour.Display- Very good resolution, the high refresh rate helps tooSmooth app handling and multitasking- even in my 8GB ram variantAudio - very nice driver range and playback quality (sounds perfectly good on good headphones and earphones)"
118,Tapan Rout,Best in the price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After one day usage, I can say this is a very good mid range phone.Pros: smooth OS, Amoled screen quality is very good, no screen tint issues.No bloatware apps like other Chinese phones.Selfie camera is goodGood build quality.Face unlock is very fast.There are 6-10 tips and tricks available in Oxygen OS which is very useful in daily usage.Cons:Rear camera does decent job, not meeting the expectation set by OnePlus.Battery drains fast whenever refresh rate is set to 90Hz.On screen fingerprint scanner is not quick compared to rear scanner.Headphone jack is not a problem for me, I am using bluetooth earbuds. Also there are type c to 3.5mm converter available in the market in 200rupees.This Mobile is  very good choice for daily normal usage. Not recommended for heavy usage."
119,Michael A Jordan,There is no better phone in this price range.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had the OnePlus 3T before I went for the Nord. I had bought the 3T for 35k and bought this 12gb variant for 30k and I have to say, it's a HUGE upgrade for me.People in the reviews keep on commenting about how the camera isn't good, while comparing it to phones outsidebita price range. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, the cameras are excellent! The only phone that may be slightly better in the camera division maybe the Samsung A51 of a similar price range. But then again, the rest of the hardware in the A51 is pretty much garbage.The battery is excellent, touch response is excellent, gaming performance is good, not the best, but good enough (not for high perfomance gaming). I play COD on it on medium graphics and works very very smoothly. The display is just magnificent.If you are looking for a phone within 30k, your search stops here."
120,Suhel,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system."
121,Moinak,Best premium midranger in this price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the 12/256 version for 28k because of amex card. Best in this price I would say.Using this phone for more than 10 days now.Almost everything about this phone is best in this price.Processor: Works really well for day to day usage and any of the modern games. It won't lag or anything with 12gb ram.Display: you won't be disappointed at all. The best in this price. Nice amoled display, nice color and everything and 90Hz on top is like the best thing. Super smooth display.Camera: main rear camera is really good captures really good picture and low light photos r also good. Macro cam I don't think is that good, gets the job done. You can additionally use Gcam also if u want.But I Didn't like the selfie camera in low light, idk what the problem is but I guess with update they will fix it. Hopefully.Battery: Nice battery backup I would say. Gives about 7 hours of screen on time with moderate usage (including little gaming).And about charging speed, 0-100% in 55 minutes if you switch off and charge. And if it's on then it takes about 70 min to charge fully.Look and feel: Really looks good, I have the grey color which really suits. Premium glass back feels really light and premium.Speaker- no dual speaker or dolby atmos, but believe me the sound is really loud and clear. Actually better than other dual speaker phones.Cons- No 3.5mm audio jack and plastic frame.Conclusion- If u don't need the audio jack then I think this is the best buy in this price. You get brand value and oxygen OS with soo many other pros. Go with it without a second thought.Happy shopping 😊"
122,KAUSIK T.,Worst Camera Quality...!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is very disappointing...even Samsung's below 20k models will take good photos. Don't get trapped by their hypes & Gimmicks...!!! Pls do watch Geekayranjith's Detailed review video before you order it. Worst thing is depth camera is fake,it's useless. If u want to own OnePlus go for other good models,don't go for NORD...!!! Instead buying it for 30k..u can prefer other brands with better overall performance under 20-25k."
123,AFFAN MOHAMED,OVERRATED MOBILE FOR THIS PERFORMANCE,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Recived on 8th August. High rated mobile for this specs.

126,Ishdeep ,Overall a very good phone by OnePlus in this segment.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good, though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from 0 to 100% in over an hour (depending on the voltage you receive ). Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update."
127,Kunal Modhe,Awesome phone with some fixable flaws!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is one of the best phones from OnePlus buf with some fixable flaws. I'm using a 12GB RAM variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os's ram management. Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly. Everyone is saying battery is great but I didn't get more than 5hours of sot that too without gaming. Final call is yours, cheers!P.s. you can not uninstall the pre-installed Netflix app."
128,Mohammad Nowmaan,Good but not great.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Timely delivered. Overall satisfied with performance but camera is not upto the mark not a camera phone at all.
129,arun,Display quality is not good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display quality is not as good, coming from the oneplus5, the amoled of Oneplus5 is far better. Color is not same and saturation is also not good. I think it's really cheap display.I didn't notice any green tint issue."
130,faizal,Display tint issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Display tint issue is there. Display turns pink and green on low brightness in dark mode.
131,Hardik bhansali,Filled with software and hardware bugs! Tread clear of it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too many bugs in the software. Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!"
132,Sudhir Kumar,Perfect mid range mobile for Indian market!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Surely the hype was worth it and so was the wait!!Pros- Display, Performance, In-display fingerprint, Premium feelCons- Mono speaker, Not so effective macro cameraBut ignore the cons and just get the device as no other mobile can compete with 12/256GB model in this range."
133,Dilip kr. Ghara,Balanced phone under 30K,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Positive:1. Good display and touch (Pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience)2. Decent sound on both speaker and earphones3. Main camera (48MP) is good4. Brilliant RAM management, No lag observed in normal usage5. Satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly6. No heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging7. Finger print and face unlock works perfectly8. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard9. Blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great. In hand feeling is good.10. The clean and add free UI of the oxigen OS will make it way different from other android phone of this budget11. Back cover is really good. No complain on the pre-applied screen guard12. Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI"
134,Partha Bhowmik,Not the best but more than average mid range phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Though it has a screen issue in low brightness but overall good device.In low light if the screen brightness is set in low then there is a black bar through the camera cutout and also has slightly greenish tint.But in regular usage it doesn't make any effect.Overall good battery in regular usage and performance is also good enough.Thanks to oxygen .....is for smooth experience.NB. Cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue. Though it has 90 hz refresh rate but some times it lags. Need to fix this minor problems.
135,Bhuvanesh Rajan,"""Nord"" A good phone under 30k segment",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Oneplus Nord... I have been using this phone since 10 August 2020 and now it's a 15 days of usage review.This phone got a lot of hypes and I think it's all worth it... If someone planning to go from 15k phone user to under 30k segment this phone is a great one for you.1. So coming to the design aspect this phone is gorgeous, don't confuse yourself by the plastic frame and all use a bumper case.2. Battery life.. Is kind of decent and I won't say it's a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it's pretty decent.3. Camera, here it's the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don't worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can't what's in the screen. Since it's 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn't look soo big and it's handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it's even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It's the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is ""no green tint"" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don't think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful."
136,Ansh,"Pathetic , worst product , waste of money as per quality",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pathetic product from oneplus , and more to add in bad experience  there pathetic customer supportBrought it and within a week it shows *Qualcomm crashdump mode*Customer supports answers after 20,30 mins and asks for problem and then put on hold for another 30 minsNo where to report issue and ask for helpInstead I would have bought 9k mobile ,that works at least for year with decent  customer  service"
137,Wasif,This phone has serious Network issues!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beware !!Oneplus nord has serious network issues.Dual VOLTE is not always working. I am not able to recieve calls. I tried with Jio sim on both slots. Even tried using idea sim on one slot with 2g network. Tried different combinations; changing primary and secondary sim's. Ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software (or hardware?) and to solve this temporarily, i am now switching on/off airplane mode every now an then. Annoying!!! I've notified this in the oneplus community forum. For more information regarding this issue, search ""Oneplus nord network issues"" in google."
138,sandeep kumar,not much as expected but..!!! its cool in this budget.. go for it,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  today i got the mobile 12+256 . delivery was delay for one day , received all in good condition.just one look it great from outside  .pros :- continue used 1 hour its little bit heat , i dont know why its happening ???? :- front camera not as reality pic it seems to add some filter app.:- there is no audio jack or rear camera quality also not too much good as expected before .:- battery drain 8% used 1 hour continue . Cons:- screen is very good as faster .:- fingerprint  & face sensor  very quick  .:-fast charging:- its look slim phone as compared to other mobile like redmi, oppo, vivo etc.:- go for it in this budget will be update the reviews  after using few days.if you wana purchase oneplus nord then go for it ... its great phone in this budget ."
139,Subhadip Chatterjee,Good1,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Lovely phone..people who are talking about bad camera quality.. must be shooting in auto mode.. the pro mode if handled properly works like a breeze n the picture quality is also fantastic. n one always insatl GCAM to improve camera performance. yes the macro cam is useless. n i think with few updates the auto mode will also work fine. the display is vibrant.. its smpoth with 90hrz refresh rate. the only thing that is bothering me is the in box back cover.. as i use gesture to navigate the phone the edge of the cover is too pronounced.. hence not been able to navigate smoothly. waiting for other cool back cover options to hit the market.
140,VIVEKACHANDIRAN R,Good Mobile for Daily usage..But not best for Pro users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good mobile but not the best..oly primay 48MP lens performs well others are just a gimmick.Selfie cam is doing the job perfectly..SD 765G is Good Enough for daily usage and again 5G is also a Marketing Stunt ..After a week usage nothing special in this mobile except oxygen os ..so u can buy this mobile only for Os and 2yrs update support nothing more can expected .Pros1.Awesome Display with 90hz smooth refresh rate2.30W warp charger is a beast,charges the battery in just 50 mins3.Primary camera  lens is good.4.oxygen os is superb to use.Major cons1.macro lens and Depth not upto mark2.single speaker just loud,not crisp it could have been atleast stereo setup3.Nightscape is good but need lot of optimization via future updates4.765G with UFS 2.1 is working fast but not lighting speed like 8 series processors just good for daily use.5.4115 Mah is ok but makes to charge twice in 24 hr usage .if u r  not a pro user just a single charge is  enough."
141,Samrat,Great phone for someone who needs a smooth and flagship like performance from a mid ranged phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I'm happy with the way this phone performs. Lets point its features out:- Great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its 90 hz refresh rate, colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty.. side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway.- Performance is great 765G is more than enough for a lite user and by this I don't mean it won't perform if you want to play a few games on it. Works beautifully.- Now the only issue I came across while using this phone was its camera, even though it's being advertised for its bomb camera setup it's really not that special. The camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot. This said I am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before OnePlus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue (well at least I hope they do!!!).So to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that's just poor :'|"
142,Chinmoy,Just the smartphone you need,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The amoled display is pretty bright and amazingNice body, feels pretty premiumOxygen OS is clean and snappyRear main Camera is greatUltra wide is okishThough the macro one is not that goodBothI think it is value for money 💰Go for it 😃"
143,Amazon Customer,That's why people say don't purchase anything by looking just at its brand.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pathetic Camera, feels like shooting by 5MP camera wayback in 2005.Main camera is atleast useful, rest is just to increase the no of sensors, so that more money should be charged from consumer.Just like OP included WARP charger in box similarly I think, OP fitted WARP discharger in the phone.that's why NORD drains battery like no other phone must be draining. I am not a heavy user or gamer but I need to charge 2 times in a day to keep mobile powered on round the clock. Don't know how and why, people in review says that battery backup is good whereas it is pathetic. Just because OP is providing fast charger, it does not mean that user should always seat next to power supply socket all the time.Above said is my Frank opinion."
144,Ajay Singh,Poor Customer Service.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought oneplus Nord last week which was delivered on 14th Aug 2020.  Phone worked well for 1 days and it stopped working on Saturday night.  I found phone is turning off and on within 30 secs on Sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network.  It would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network.  It hangs and turn offs immediately.  I contacted Amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till Wednesday.  A technician will come on Wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not.  Nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early.  I have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product.Very pathetic service and will not recommend to Anyone.
145,Rahul Madhavan,Go for it if you need new phone. For upgrade you can wait,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall: 1. Solid phone. great camera2. Buy if you want 5G and have budget for 25-30k. Else you can go for realme/oppo at 10k lower cost.3. Much much better OS than xiomi/redmi. No bloatware. even oneplus app come default disabled!4. I loved the cameras even though online people have said camera is not so good. But again it's hit and miss. Some of the night pics (or those with light in background) i took seemed over-processed and/or pixelated. In such cases change the settings5. Sturidiness is good. But still buy with insurance. Screens once gone never come back!---5G: This is really something I don't think i'll need. i'm happy with 4G for all my needs. This shifting of spectrum is a total money making business. The shift from 3G-4G was necessary, but put unnecessary pressure on telecom players who had invested lakhs of crores on 3G spectrum for 20-30 year leases. That time reliance was the only early one to buy 4G spectrum at deep discounts (probably knowing before-hand about regime change). Again, I think 5G is a scam to help reliance make money (and 4G spectrum buyers like airtel lose money). I dont see myself needing 5G anytime in near future.Safety: I've broken my oppo 3 months back. Used an older Redmi. Which broke in one fall in 2 months. Used a broken phone for 2 months so this was important to me. This comes with plastic guard and screenguard inbuilt. Plastic guard is larger at corners.Weight: It seems sturdy enough. But lots of online reviews say the phone if mishandled can breakBatteries: Great fast charging! I charge once a day and charge for 30 minutes or so. even a five minute charge lasts for 2-3 hours (of video calling)Speed: I'm not a gamer or anything, but seems fast enough easily for all my needs.Close to Stock Android: I used to go for xiaomi and realme which completely spoil the android experience with their own versions. Might I say the xiaomi version was pure evil. It used to hoist a much of MI apps on me. If i uninstall MI Pay, the next morning, it used to come back, on it's own! Oxygen is such a relief after these. The OS -Muhc Much better than Xiaomi. Marginally better than Oppo and Realme.Build: I liked the build. It comes with its own cover. The cover has extra protection at the corners and has special seal for battery area so water doesn't get in.Camera: Comes with lots of cameras. How do these help? They give  the software a chance to build a composite image, capture more light in a shorter interval and get depth perception easier.Close up camera: I have captured a baby butterfly/moth which was smaller than a fingernail. This was at full zoom. Though i was only holding with hand, there is no blurriness on image. Details have come out adequately. Supposedly i could have done a macro but the camera interface doesn't easily open up all the features. For example I had to fiddle around before i could figure out how to switch on the flash.Nightvision Camera: 3 exhibits for your viewing pleassure. I have done a comparison between the actual photos in the night, and the modified photos as captured by the cameras. As you can see, the captures have completely improved the lighting. I have not captured using tripod for long exposure etc and yet shakiness is not too high. The starkest effect is in the selfie captured where it seems like day! the colors in the modified image are true to actuals. This was very surprising to me!Selfies: Good camera as gets nice depth. Use with google photos to ensure you never run out of space for photos!Color: Blue is my favorite color, and I love the pastel blue of this phone."
146,Sarthak,Overall Beast in this Price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is better to say it is very good deal right now(i bought when it was launched). It is very balanced phone, not a beast in any specific area. It must it is a phone which most of users want. Moreover, OxygenOs is icing on a cake.You are paying more price because of oxygen os. It will get some price cut.Cameras are above average. Main Camera (primary camera) is pretty good and ultra wide also captures good shots but due it is 8MP lens so details will get lost if you zoomed.Battery is one day. Although, you get 30T warp charger which charges a device 70% in 30 mins.No lags no heating issues no bloatware in software.Yeah, processor has less powerful as compared to 800 series processor but it easily done tasks as 845 do."
147,SHIVAM,Overhyped Phone ☹️,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Firstly One plus has make the customer fool during the OnePlus Nord Ar launch of amount ₹99 to all who Purchased their launch event card. About phone it is the most hyped phone which doesn't meet my expectations. Lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack.No Dedicated micro-sd card slot.The 2 MP and 5 MP cameras are useless. Overall build quality is good. Oxygen Os (Great Android Experience and future updates).Decent front and Rear cameras.The In-display fingerprint scanner.Fast Processor and Above Average Display.The battery is decent and supports fast charging.
148,Ashish Kumar,Excellent Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One Plus has come up with a great product in correct pricing. This is what is required.The cameras are superb and at par with phones costlier than thisFast chargingIt is 5G ready. Means when 5G will come to India this feature will be enabled through OTA. Only one Sim will be 5G . Other will be 4G. Remember it is like older phones when 4G was avaiable in only one sim in dual phones.One Plus Nord is a good buy
149,Anindaya S Rana,A very balanced phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It is not a flagship if you want that experience. It is a really good midrange experience coming from one of the better brands. You can certainly get more value for money from other brands however the quality of software support and customer service from OnePlus is better than all such brands. A must buy especially if you love oxygen os or just want a reliable device to use for 2-3 years .
150,Neha Sharma,Oxygen OS and display tries to make up for pathetic cameras but fails,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Following is my review of the device -PROS -1. The display is amazing.2. Oxygen OS is really clean, good, and easy to use.3. The Alert Slider button is helpful.4. Charging is fast ( not as much as Realme X2 pro but quite fast)CONS -1. The camera is bad, really bad. Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices."
151,Abhay Kumar,Perfect mid ranger by miles!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's the perfect mid ranger. It's snappy and smooth with 90 hz, display is good albiet a tad low on brightness. Will test with 60z on and update later on. The best thing about the Nord is the OxygenOS. Got an update to version 10.5.5 immediately on starting the phone. The phone is a bit tall and I would have liked a bit more width like Samsung M30s which was was previous phone before this. The warp charge works as promised ... got to 0%-100% in 107 mins after the phone was installed with almost 100 apps, which I thing I was consuming some battery in the background. Haven't tasted camera much except couple of selfies which  turned out perfectly okay in night light, and daylight photography returned decent pictures. About sound quality - music volume is pretty loud for a mono speaker and can get distorted on full volume. Call volume is good but not very load. Phone speaker volume is a bit on low side which I disliked. Marble blue colour shines on day light and night which looks awesome. The phone case provided with the box is good one. Start guide is a joke and not much given in it except placement of various buttons. Will update more since it's been only a day of usage for me."
152,Varun Krishnan,Utterly disappointing!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  ‌OnePlus had always come across as a company that delivered on its promises to customers. But sadly, the Nord marks their deviation from this customer-centric philosophy. They have stooped to the level of mediocre companies making empty claims about their products! Nord is utterly disappointing, its cameras (claimed to be on par with OP 8 series) is worse than ones found in below 15k phones ,  monospeaker gives tough competition to those in cheapest phones ,  display has pink tinting issue, battery drains in no time, all in all it points to use of substandard hardware all round which makes this phone not worth even 15k!!  OnePlus also seems to have bought out all the top reviewers so that they can effectively mislead prospective buyers."
153,Rajesh Hali,Nord is worth the hype,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Worth the hype.Good phone in this budget segment.Bought the 12gb ram 256 gb on pre order and am satisfied with the performace. Camera takes good photos in natural light and with flash. Selfie camera is also good. Battery life is not that great . Does drain quite quiclky. The finishing looks premium with Corning gorilla glass on the front and the back. Heavy duty games work sufficiently well with a little heating.
154,APURAV,Disappointing from one plus.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I have order nord on pre book day. I want to order blue marble 256Gb but it was not available on 28 July. So I compromise and order grey one. My friend order blue marble on 6 August on open sale day and recevied phone on 7 August. Even though I order phone on pre booking day (28july) I received on 8 august. Very disappointing from one plus as they delivered product to open sale customer rather than those customer who has booked phone on pre booking day. I want to get replace it with blue one. I trying to contact Amazon through call but they disable call us option for this product. One plus just created hype for Nord. They didn't provided customer service. There is also issue in bullet z connection.
155,Gopinath,Worth for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It's above average for mid range phones.1) Battery life is good it's regular normal using stand by 14 hrs2) Gaming performance : It's average only and playing games some network connectivity issues happened3 ) Display is really nice / daily usage feel better4) Camera : Below average only software updates required .In night time it's quality is very low..
156,SK,👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the few disadvantages is that 3.5mm jack is missing (supports only bluetooth earphones) and also supports only and only nano sim...otherwise the price range and the features considered, it's a great phone to buy within that budget 👍"
157,Arvind,Don't go for negative reviews ! THIS PHONE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  THIS PHONE IS JUST AMAZING.ALL FEATURES IN ONE PHONE AT THIS PRICE NOTHING LESS THAN A FLAGSHIP PHONE .SURELY YOU CAN GO FOR IT , WITH CLOSED EYES"
158,Alfin Philip,Well it's not as bad as people say it is !!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A lot of people have given their expert opinions here so I'm just gonna address a few things.1)Display:- Yes there is a tint issue but I feel Oxygen Os 10.5.7.AC01DA has solved it to an extent.My recommended setting isDisplay calibration>Advanced>Display P3 and tone it down to cold.2)Camera:- I seriously don't know why people are soooo critical about the cameras. I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great. It's mainly due to that 90hz refresh rate.P.S:-Not attaching any photos there are enough of them here 😂
159,kyu btau,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.* Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.* 60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that.* The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.* The phone looks and feels premium while using.* Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)i suggest this nord for who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints.."
160,You,A truly mediocre phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus phone so I had my expectations in check. After using it for a while I feel indifferent towards the brand itself as there's absolutely nothing remarkable about this phone worth talking about which why I'll only be talking about the issues I have with this phone.Had poor charging speeds at first. After a few System updates, that fixed it for me even though there was nothing about battery in the change log.Camera is...well not a flagship by any means as they've tried it market it to their fans. If this is what passes for flagship these days, OnePlus is going to have a hard time ahead. Apparently, it's the same module as the OnePlus 8 but the functionality is limited and quality worse even. Although I personally think for a 30k phone, it's okay.I don't play games on my phone but after watching a movie for a few minutes the display does heat up a little. Nothing too serious yet but time will tell. Any heat issues will more or less cause the battery to degrade faster.There's an problem with my phone where sometimes after a fresh boot the phone will not show SIM signal for some reason even though it detects it just fine. Another reboot does fix it all the time but it's minor inconvenience/nuisance that shouldn't be happening.The UI is pretty clean. Don't have many complaints here except for the gaming software bloatware and the lack of a music app. Yes, yes I know there's many apps in the Playstore that gets the job done but that is true for literally most OnePlus apps yet it didn't stop them for making those. Coming from a Samsung phone, it's a problem for me because Samsung has their own music and video player that don't show ads or anything. It does have Google Play music app but I didn't like the orange UI with light background and other playstore apps don't integrate with the OnePlus lockscreen well."
161,shweta jaiswal,Reasonable product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  For 28k and some exchange I found this product value for money. For 30k I don't think so, reason being camera quality in low light conditions is poor. Marketing on the basis of 4 camera is being done by one Plus but it turns out that macro camera is not good at all.I would definitely say that picture quality in day light conditions is osm. Gaming experience is smooth with no heating issues. Better life n charging speed bith are phenomenon."
162,Amazon Customer,Delivary and customer service very poor,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone Is Great Deal with Premium feel and Touch.I bought original one plus cover and glass protection.Back cover gives premium feel .Amoled screen enhances overall experiences.Friends don't listen to youtubers .No tint issues no lags .Those who expect high end features in 30 k just grab the deal.Only issue faced with Amazon prime delivary .Amazon delivery agents threaten to cancel the delivary if i not collect it from its warehouse.Due to urgecy i had to collect it.I called the customer care but they could not able to fix the issue.I experienced third class delivary despite Amazon prime member.Delivary agents don't even protect the privacy of customers they ask for product information .

165,Jayakumar,"After Oneplus X, my 2nd Oneplus Phone is ""NORD""",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is good looking and handy, feels like a premium phone, Camera is awesome and must buy phone under 30,000/-. More fully it doesn't feel more weight and feels really weightless one and warp charge also does its job quickly and when my phone is at 80%, while you charge it shows 8 to 9 minutes to get fully charged. Phone doesn't get heat while charging....including charge holder."

167,Nelson O J,"Stable, reliable, feature rich, almost a flagship!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A well made product when it comes to build quality. The processor is fairly capable, no slouch at all.Coming from a OnePlus 3 as my previous phone and this feels like a major upgrade, no lags, no stutters and looks great too.The macro camera was sub par but has gotten better with updates,  the rest of the camera array is great.Speaker sounds decent.No network issues so far.Great battery life and charging speed is pretty good.When I'm buying a phone I usually look for being able to use all my apps without issues, a good video and photo camera and a reliable battery.This ticks all those boxes.In fact this has reduced my battery anxiety quite a bit as it lasts and allows for a fair bit of usage and a quick 15 to 20 minutes top-up allows you to keep going for quite a bit.The relative stability of Oxygen OS makes it a reliable daily driver."
168,Navi,Warm Display Auto Brightness Issues Green Pink Violet Tint Issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Everything is fine except that green pink violet tint issues and warm display issues auto brightness issues i got headache due to that issuesAnd when i approached Amazon they responded quickly but they're not able to provide a replacement so with a heavy heart proceeded with a refundBut now I'm in a confusion should i buy again or notBecause i want a mobile without any issues because we're spending 30k and we don't change mobile's so often so i need a mobile without any issuesIf you're okay with the issues you can buy it without any confusion and if you're lucky enough you'll get a mobile without any display or ant issues good luck with your new Nord
169,Sunil Kumar,"awesome deal, go for it if u have a budget of (25-30k)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  battery-unexpectedly good,1.5 day for normal use (i am not a gamer and never gave heavy load on phone)camera-(main)-good enough, better thn all mid range phones of this range and excellent dynamic range.micro camera_ totally trash :( (also not my requirement)video camera-(first class) 4k is awesome and video stablization is decentfront camera- ok ok type for this range of phonedisplay- good display (no low light tint issue)look- loved its look, awesome balanced weightOS- awesome and best experience on oxygen, found a lot of new features in this phone"
170,Amazon Customer,Best premium phone is budget value.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  if you are looking for premium phone with below mention quality.1. Best UI ( Speed interaction with app and ad free2. Best camera quality - camera is same as oneplus 83. best AMOLED screen - awesome black and brightness, vivid color experience4. Best battery back up and charging speed- 1 hr full charge/ 30 min - 70%5. 90HZ smooth refresh rate - it actually cool if haven't experience6. great loud speaker quality - its feels premium and with little bass -7. compact size phone - not big and not small - perfect hand size for all daily use.8. support of good developers and quality team -from my side there is no CON in phone as my last phone was redmi note 4 ( we should create less e waste and Value our money )I miss headphone jack, however we should accept modern technology and use Bluetooth earphone as 3.5mm jack is way more old technology.i suggest spend on phone who last long with less ( zero ) problems so choose it wisely, instead of spending 20K- 23k on redmi, samsung or other, Oneplus really provide value for money."
171,Rajesh,Experience with display is a big disappointment.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all, this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations. Amzed with the features offered, I Pre-ordered Oneplus nord and waited 9 days for the delivery. After switching on my device, I just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display. This is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels. My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying."
172,Manish Singh,Not up to the mark(From a Oneplus fan),4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I m a OnePlus fan, still disappointed. The green and magenta tint on display is very real, whenever there is something grey on the screen which will be  a lot if you use dark mode, the display just goes crazy, showing all tints from green to pink.Secondly, there are some issues with Google Play services that doesn't load up a search or a page in one go but that might get fixed with ota.Cameras are a mixed bag, if you take selfies soo much, it sucks in indoor lighting conditions, very good in outdoors but not indoors.Rest of the phone is what you would expect, 90Hz display,you will forget after using it for a day and when u go back to 60hz it's not a discernable difference as every reviewer says so. You will see difference b/w 60 nd 120hz but not so much here.Buy this only if you are looking for a OnePlus phone, otherwise there's better out there."
173,Manju,Just LOVING it!!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The main highlight is the software experience u get....it's just awesomeAnd i would say it's overall balanced phoneDecent picturesDescent audio from the monospeakerDescent haptic feedbackDecent premiumnessBut one issue : it has slight tint issue in the grey background (ignorable)I would say its worth it!!!!
174,Amit singh,Totaly satisfied and happy with the performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome phone,great performance, no lag while gaming,I have tried pubg, cod, asphalt 9 all are running super smoth at high settings,charging is also super fast, No screen issue for me, Totaly satisfied with the phone. Don't listen to the youtubers they are all sold to other brands, trust me you will not get a better phone than this at 30k price."
175,abhinav,Overall Good Performance but with mediocre Camera performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  No problem with the Nord Performance, as usual it poses no problem in daily taks, also Oxygen OS is best out there but the most advertised feature ^Camera^ isn't that good. The front camera selfie in indoor shot is not clear , it's giving whitish on face , also the back camera 48MP is best but it has less features , the macro and depth camera doesn't give satah factory result. The camera isn't good in this one. Hjghl disappointed.maybe some update in future will help in this issue"
176,Devaraj Samuel,Not as much as u Think or Expect,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Just after using one day the phone os crashed... had to boot to the main menu using power n volume button.. i didn't update the system after installing new apps from play store .. system update - is that a reason to blame..If so - y can't it be made forceful...For a 30k phone the hand experience by improving the build quality s expected.. one plus 5 s more solid i feel
177,Amazon Customer,Worst Phone Don't Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am using dual  sims. after every 2-3 hours, outgoing and incoming call facility is not working. although there is full network. then I had switch on the aeroplane mode and off the same to enable the calls"
178,Arun,Network detection keeps losing,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  when you go and come back to low network area, phone loses its connection with the network and never recovers, need to restart the phone. This is a major problem, lot of my friends/relatives started complaining that am not reachable for the whole day. Oneplus, you need to work on this.Redmi note 8 pro was far better than this."
179,Sambit Sahoo,Wonderful phone 🔥👌.. but seriously getting many problems.. it's really true.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I really loved everything.. its UI.. features.. battery life is really good.. charging speed is also well.. other all aspects are pretty good.. speakers are not that bad.. enough for a phone but still it lacks.. camera is good.. but expections were much high..Accessories costs very much.. Overall good one but now comes to its issues..That display tint issue.. connectivity problems sometimes.. then idk why but charging is not that fast.. then game like ff isn't working properly idk still why.. camera optimization is poor..PLEASE THOSE WHO ALL HAVE THESE GREEN TINT ISSUE IN YOUR PHONES BETTER TO GET A REPLACEMENT OR RETURN.. BECAUSE IT'S A HARDWARE FAULT.. I've gone for a replacement n as stocks aren't there so I got the refund. Better do it unless you want a defect product..🙂
180,HG,Pathetic Phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone has severe network issues and loses network very frequently. Call drops and Network unavailable most of the time. This is not an operator issue as I'm at home only in lockdown and get proper signal in other phones in the house.Secondly, even if you manage to get network, the phone has a very bad heating problem. Within 5-10 minutes of voice call the phone heats up badly and becomes unusable. You have to wait for it to cool before being able to use again.Lastly, the battery drain is too bad. Morning 8am at 100% gets to single digit by 5pm with average usage. If I try to watch videos/game then it goes down faster, but you don't have to worry about it as within 15 minutes of watching video/gaming the phone will heat up and give you a notification that some functions have been disabled to reduce temperature. So you don't worry about watching video or gaming for long.Overall too many bugs which are not resolved. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.."

183,LonelyiGamer,"Product, great as expected, shipping from Amazon, wasn't the best",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord is most probably the best in this price segment and apart from Google Pixel, nothing would come anywhere near, camera is pretty good, my only problem is the Macro camera. It doesn't do any good and it's just an additional, main camera is pretty much does the same as the Macro does"
184,ABDUL VAHAB A M,Awesome mobile.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint Reader is very fast when comparing to other brands.Battery life is pretty draining.

185,Chunu,My expectations for this phone gone into Disappointment 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using this phone about a month.Facing problems like its gone in booting mode automatically and it takes 15-20 min to restart the phone again .Second thing is its charging speed gone slow .In first month its charging speed (0 to70% in 30min) is like as said by a company .But now it take 1h30min to full charge . I am very disappointed.Camera quality is goodBattery is also goodFace unlock is mind blowing very excellent 5/5 rating.Charging speed 2/5
186,Priyanka,Beware of Fanboys 😡 'Must Read',1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day."
187,akh1l,Battery really gave up within a week.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very happy at first buying an oneplus phone and was also very satisfied by it's performance but today it's just been around a week since I bought the phone and aside from the lacking of processor like I already knew settling for a lesser snapdragon processor would only provide little stability and max graphics of HD at games like PUBG, but today aside from the quality lacking in front camera like clearly phones like galaxy M31 provide a much better front camera I saw this status in battery and the phone got really heated up and the battery status showed that it needed 1 hour and 45 minutes to get fully charged I mean a warp charging phone how can it show signs like this within the first week itself. Really disappointed from oneplus on this one."
188,Amazon Customer,Loyal customer to one plus,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon.Likes: Phone is simply awesome. This is my second buy from One Plus (first one was one plus 3t). In simple words i really loved the phone.  The grey one looks really nice. Though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice. Good one.Well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack . We need to use a connector . Rest all good. I guess the One Plus Lite model will have that wire jack feature.
189,kartik,Had second thoughts while ordering but now loved it..,4.0 out of 5 stars,   4.5stars from my side.The rear camera is good specially the 48mp mode . The only thing which is useless is the macro camera.The selfie shooter is good. Just a bit of distort in potrait mode .But i believe all the camera problems which people are feeling will be fixed by updates.Just like it was in the first realme phones.The gaming experience is good.Refresh rate and game mode helps alot.Tried both PUBG and ASPHALT 9The sound from the speakers are good.Charging was super quick.Battery ran for the day despite of high usage .The inscreen Fingerprint is a bit Slow but the faceunlock is superfast..Overall its a must buy for the person who dreamt of buying oneplus but cud not cz of the budget ..Also its a 5G enabled phone .I mean go for it guys..

191,Raksha,OnePlus Nord - Just An Average phone!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received phone today! Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery!To all Nord buyers please consider this review seriously!!!Oneplus Nord made a lot of buzz but delivers nothing much great!Camera - 2/5 just average*Quality - 2/5 , the cost cutting is so visible!Display - 3/5 ,it's bright but not impressive...Gaming - 2/5 ,especially Pubg players please stay away from this! Performance is too poor and graphics settings are very low... Don't get fooled by  any YouTube videos!Color - 4.5/5 It's bold and colorfull..Fingerprint - 4/5 works really fast!Overall - 2.5/5 Expected more then wat received and the expectations were set by the OnePlus Ads..To all oneplus premium users or New buyers this phone is not for you, please go by the specs not by company's name! From my experience , OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 6T is way better then Nord! So I suggest you to go for OnePlus 7T/Realme X2 pro..I ll add/update after a month if changes found 👍"
192,vicky,I hope I use it atleast for 1 year,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am giving feedback after use of 1 week. Over all phone is good, sometime it gets slow. I faced hanging issue at the very first day but then after that did not face such issue . Sometime I can't listen any voicemails or videos, it gets blanked then I have to restart device. It happened twice in a week and when it's brand new phone it's not acceptable. Only 48 MP cam is quite good, rest all are ok ok but not good..I don't know why this people have gave that 2 MP cam, instead of that they would have given 3.5 mm jack or something else.  Battery life is more than average, it's good to use. I only love one thing that is charger. I will edit review later if anything gets changes in performance.Facing bluetooth connectivity issue like alot. It's not acceptable."
193,Bikash Borah,Average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Average product but price little bit high. I have been using this phone since 48hours and my view regarding the user experience and overall performance I mentioned below as pro and cons formatPro: 1. Clean and clear android OS and fully customisable2. Fully charge within 30-45min from 10-12%3. Battery performance not so bad (7-8 hours) (4-5hours with 90Hz RR and game like COD/A9)4. Dark mode is awesome5. Processors works good with high end games like CoD/PUBG/A96. Premium feels without coverCons :1. Heating issue with high end game and apps like Unacademy2. Camera dept very worst. Only main cam works fine other 3cam just for show off3. If you switch from LCD screen to OLED you will feel pain in your eyes or sever dizziness Within 30mins of use4. YouTube Video available up to 1080. 4K video option not available5. Fingerprint And face unlock features , I Donot think it’s secure enough6. Plastic side body so use with care. I got screech within a hour of unboxing7. 90Hz RR consume more juice than 60hzMore pro and cons will be updates soon......"
194,Abhishek Mehta,Amazing Phone - One Plus Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best valued phone which I got. 12 Gb Ram and 256 Gb storage at the best price. I have actually booked the phone on 27th July and received the phone 1 day before the launch. I was surprised on the Delivery Schedule of Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the early delivery.One Plus phones I always rely on for a longer term of about 2 to 3 years. Upgrading my One Plus 6 to Nord was an outstanding deal. Thanks One Plus for early dispatch.About the phone :1. It is 5G Ready, though we don’t have 5G Network in India. (It’s coming)2. The camera quality is outstanding.3. Voice output same as other One Plus models4. A little sleeker than other models.5. Finish on the edges is truly praising.6. Colour of the phone (Grey) is soothing.7. Transparent back bumper Cover along with the phone is of good quality.All in all, I love this phone so much I am planning to buy one more."
195,shree,NORD so far.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall perfomance of the phone is amazing.best in class perfomance in this price range .It feels really nice in the hands.Best diplay for this price i'd say. Camera is definitely similar to oneplus 8,but its not the same although,nord is lacking some of the features of oneplus 8 camera.charging is pretty fast 0 to 100 in less than an hr. eventhough the battery is morethan 4000 mah the display and hardware comsumes a lot of power, so battery backup is not so great but above average.Operating system is lot smoother with less bugsOverall i my perspective,considering the brand value and the product value oneplus is giving,for sure it ll be really a money worth purchase.PROS*Supperb camera perfomance in this price range .*Pretty quick charging.*Nyz display in this price*Front camera wide angle is awesome.*bigger display and 90Hz refresh rate.*Smooth os with less bugs.CONS*Lacking the premium buit quality out of the box.Overall its a plastic body*The volume mute slider feels a bit low quality in the daily usage.*In display fingerprint scanner is not as faster as a sidemounted scanner.*Battery backup is not great as expected but considering the display size ,its ok with that.*Sometimes proximity censor goes crazy while calling and endup with making the call hold or muted probably."
196,Sameer Kulkarni,Premium Device in Higher Midrange: Must Read!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is a decent High-Mid range smartphone which gives promising performance and overall great value for money.Look & In-hand feel:Excellent look and build except the frame which is plastic. Corning gorilla glass 5 on both sides is good protection against physical scratches and damages. In hand weight balance is pretty good. Doesn't feel heavier.Build quality:With some compromises due to its price, it's still a robust device to own. A typical premium feel.UI & OS:Excellent job. No complaints here. Clean UI and bloatware free OS gives a seamless performance.Battery:Average 7 hours SoT with normal usage.So decent battery life. No heating issues. 30T warp charging does a great job. 50~55 min for 0 to 100.Camera:Good hardware for camera in place, but scope of improvement still exists.Pros:-Great 90Hz fluid amoled display-5G enabled-Clean UI-Decent Camera-Alert slider-30 watt fast chargingCons:-No expandable storage-No headphone jackVerdict:Go for it if you want decent overall performance as Q 765G won't offer the same performance as Q 855 or 855+ hence gamers need to rethink. Overall Great Device!"
197,Swapneel,Ignore YouTube reviews and Go For Nord and experience best in class product from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ignore all reviews on YouTube or any other channel and you will have a best phone in your hand and that is OnePlus Nord. I gone through reviews but still I took chance and now I am totally satisfied with my decision of buying Nord. Everything is best in class from built quality to cameras and performance. Super smooth performance without any lag and also no ads big relief. For headphone jack you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy usb c type to 3.5 mm jack converter from local market,I got it for 120rs and believe me it is awesome sound with powerful base.(my headphones are of iphone). Phone speaker is very loud most of us use headphones so that is not a issue. Macro camera is not that good bt again that's not a big issue bcz rear camera click stunning pictures also nightscape mode gives superb results. Front camera is awesome. Battery backup a big thumbs up for it bcz I am normal user. Charges in time which is promised by company. Finally Never Settle for any other phone go for Nord."
198,Nikhil Khot,Bad Camera and Tint issue with display! Otherwise great phone.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's really great device and awesome daily driver. But it's seems like OnePlus really lacks in camera and display quality. Yes camera is bad if you someone who want better camera and take lot of pictures then this phone is not for you at all. About the display well display is good but yes it do have tint issue and it's noticable and also effecting using experience if your really serious about color and pictures as a artist or creative person well it might bother you some time specially in night or low brightness condition. So at the end it's good phone to buy and hopefully OnePlus may fix this issue vai update. Give it thought before you buy and also look for some other options. Other things like battery, figure print, charging works fine and no lag at all."
199,jerald raja,Not a good midrange mobile,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  *Being OnePlus user from oneplus3.. Expected lot from this mobile..  *Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles.OnePlus 5 series is the last premium mobile from op.  *one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced  *don't go on brand name and look.  *Now a days samsung is very strong with their midrange mobiles.  *1.Camera is literally bad, I mean really really bad  2. If you are a selfie lover please don't go with this  3. CPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships  4. Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output  5.Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBG  6.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS  7.Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  8.Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength*"
200,pollam vinod yadav,Nord is a flop moblie it just created a hype,1.0 out of 5 stars,  My phone is good but after I got delivered it stopped working on 5th day I got software problem and it started rebooting itself I went to one plus customer service and I got replaced after one week and I have seen there same problem like me by many persons so please don't buy this product.at this cost u can another moblie.
201,Aryan Upadhyay,"Worth buying, kind of.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honest review.3 Things I liked the most-1. DisplayIt's a quite good display with colour vibrancy and gool colour reproduction. Its 90hz panel so it's smooth af too. Amoled display with 90hz is just heaven. Viewing angles ? GREAT!2. Battery lifeI'm getting around 19 hrs of battery life on one full charge which is decent because I don't do much of gaming in this, I just use it for social media, youtube and stuff.3. ChargingIt's bloody fast in charging like it charges 10% to 90% under 40 mins which is quite good.And other things like processor, ram, storage is fast, looks premium in hand since bulid quality and looks are eye catching, every camera is good and can take beautiful pictures but I found macrolens camera useless.Thing which I didn't like is that it doesn't have a headphone jack so now my bose wired headphones are somewhat useless while using this phone.Thank you for reading."
202,Sujeet,Don't buy Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   I didn't accepted from one plus brand 'Nord' please don't buy this One plus Nord . I don't want to give any star,but for review I will giving one star .guys plz check my video before purchasing this nord device and I visited one plus store they updated and installed new software again same issue with this device so plz don't buy"
203,Bhoopendra Uikey,Not what I expected,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Screen :- very good, AMOLED 90hz screen is a beauty, very impressed with it.2. Camera :- images look very grainy in indoor photos, can be easily fixed with software update, using gcam for now, day and night difference.3. Audio :- was not expecting that good sound but it has very good single speaker.4. Performance :- Device not optimised for gaming.  This phone was having frame drops even in 2d games. My previous 14k phone had less frame drop than this. Although graphics were better in this phone.5. Battery :- good enough battery, not great.6. Software :- I had ordered this because of oos, but in new update they have changed whole ui and it looks nothing like stock. Stock-like ui was the reason I had ordered this. I guess I have to rely on custom ROMs just like my last phone.Edit: Now after 1 week I am completely disappointed with its performance, too much frame drops even compared to sd730g mobiles, I'm not talking about games like pubg or so, it skips frame even in Subway surf and too much frame skips in Minecraft and angry birds transformer, latter two are almost unplayable for me. These games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games, terrible optimization, I was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games, which it is notEdit : just installed call of duty, surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops. They were there, but I was looking for them, otherwise smooth experience, do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not, I did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate, which it delivers in cod but in others, fails to do so"
204,Pranav Khedekar,"Amazing Display and Performance, Sub-Par Camera.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a mixed bag of goodies and baddies. As usual, the Unboxing experience is Wholesome and includes an amazing Red Cable Club's Membership Card which is mesmerizing to stare at for hours. As for the phone, like aforementioned it's kind of mixed review. Firstly, the display is amazing for 28k and with that 90Hz display the phone dosent feels less than an flagship. Camera is Sub-Par (which was expected as OnePlus do not have a very good track record with Camera's ), but it's not that bad either. It captures some amazing details in good-light conditions, but under low-light conditions, things go downhill. Also, OnePlus should have avoided that Quad-Camera gimmick and instead of 2MP Macro camera should have developed or perfected the Main sensor for Low-Light conditions. Also the front shooters are good, but beautify the photo too much, that the photos look unreal. Also, didn't quite understand why OnePlus introduced 4K 60fps video recording in front cams, and deprived main camera setup of this. Other than that, the phone is as good as one can get in this in this price-point. The OxygenOS is alone an amazing reason why you should choose this phone over others. It's beautifuly optimized and together with that 90Hz panel gives an flagship like performance (apparently). As for actual performance, 765G is not an bad chipset and is decent for casual gaming and more than enough for smooth performance in  daily life. The battery is amazing and so is 30W Warp charger. So, the bottom line is if you want an future-proof smartphone with decent performance, go for this one. But if you are looking an device for Heavy gaming or Mobile photography, then this is not an ideal phone for you. Finally, no device is perfect, but this one without an doubt is bang for buck."
205,Abhishek P.,Great phone but poor marketing gimmick by Amazon by showcasing Reviewers edition hard cases,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is amazing in terms of experience, customisation, battery life and camera quality - yes, the rumours about camera quality isn't true and I'm very happy with it. However, the seller and Amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that I never received. Even after complaining to Amazon customer care, I was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to Amazon, hence passing the buck! Not a great experience!"
206,karan vig,Touch,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I used to play pubg by 4 or 3 finger claw but in this phone nord I can't properly play by 3 fingers because I'm so much problem with multitouch so this is happen with me only or its a phone bug.
207,Dhananjay,One of the best phone in this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Been using this phone for about 15 days now and I think it's one of the best phones in this price range. Everything is good. I mean it's not as good as a flagship but in this price range everything we have is amazing. The screen is amazing. And you can buy this phone for oxygen is only. Cameras are good, primary camera is great and wide angle is good too. But other two are just there for the quad camera perform and nothing much they don't have manu use here I mean the depth camera is good but if you cover it and then click a portrait pic then also you will get the same pic. But overall if your budget is under 30k then go for this phone you will love the experience."
208,Arpita,Worst phone ever by Oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of my biggest bad decision to buy oneplus nord. One of the useless phone I have ever seen. There is several reasons behind my sentences.1. There is no 3.5 Jack so u have to buy Bluetooth earphone, and Bluetooth is not working at all. It's not detecting oneplus earphones and if it's connected it will disconnect in few minutes. Go and search on Google u will get lots of topic regarding this.2. Phone music quality is too bad on every earphone.3. Phone doesn't have SD card support, so you can't take any backup directly to external memory. What was happened to me and I lots approx 300+ contacts and huge amount of photos.4. The mobile software has huge bugs and I am damn sure it was not tested properly.5. Mobile has plastic body, seriously for what I paid this much amount. Backside Chinese logo?6. Battery is too bad, even it's not capable to run for full day.I just want my money back and take this nonsense, most irritated device."
209,Rohit Jain,Worst display,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst Display.It is having green tint issue not only in dark mode or dark environment. You can see the tinting also in Google Chrome opening page . Shades of green and different patches of whites sha des are clearly noticeable. Display is really an issue . Do think before buying
210,Ayon Chakraborty,Awesome purchase!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Okay, I was extremely excited for my first OnePlus smartphone.Most of the things are awesome in this price point but there are few things which is disappointing.1) Camera: It's good but not best for indoor photography. But as I observed, it shows the picture and after capturing and processing, it tweaks with contrast, colors, etc etc.. Therefore, I assume the problem I mentioned can be fixed by an update2) Battery: It's neither good nor bad. It lasts for 5hrs to 8hrs depending on the usage @90hz refresh rate. But downgrading the refresh rate to 60hz and enabling battery saver pushes this to 8hrs to 10hr average. But using this @90hz without battery saver is the one I do because of the fast charging. It's just awesome! It charged 60% to 100% in 20 minutes.I am coming from a low budget android *Redmi note 3*If you are thinking to upgrade from any similar or equivalent device, I would definitely recommend to do so because those are the only two problems I faced tbh. and they are not as problematic. The oxygen os with this 8Gb ram, SD765g, and 90hz display is extremely smooth."
211,Unni K Nayanar,The best option you can get...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is dope on both software and the quality. The camera quality is great but not that great when it is in macro mode . There are a few bugs when using camera on certain apps , the quality of the photo decreases. The battery life is good . The wrap charging is not upto the point . The front camera notch gets me irritated while playing games as some of the buttons go under it and you won't get to know. Other than the bugs , this is the best phone in premium budget category.Once you start using OnePlus phones you never want to go into an another mobile company . OnePlus is ❤️"
212,Mudit,Oneplus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone.Great price.I am amazed with warp charger as it charges within an hour from 19%to 100%.I was new to oneplus so didn't knew that phone should be charged with company charger and lead else it could affect battery life but getting used to it.Though Nord is a cheaper version of oneplus but I found it premium quality and upto mark in all respect from camera quality, finger print sensor to multi tasking.Battery is good but will last only one day or less if you are a heavy user but since charging is very fast so you are least worried.So if you are looking for a premium mobile that is 5G enabled plus less than 30k go for it, you won't repent."
213,SAMPATH,I loved it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really loved it.Using this for a day, and its really amazing and I love it.I didn't observe any tint issue on my piece at least. Even if there is any issue at low brightness, that doesn't effect the regular user in anyway.The only competitor I see to Oneplus nord at this point of time is Realme X2pro.If you are confused between these two:1. Go with Realme only if you want it for games and want the 55W fast charging.2. Go with Oneplus if you want an overall great experience, with the software, camera, changing, processor. And I think it's perfect phone at this price segment.Pros:1. 90Hz display.2. Oxygen OS.3. Stable 4k Video recording.4. 32mp front camera does a great job.5. 5G support with a great processor.6. 30W charging and battery that lasts for a day on heavy use.7. Assured software updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years.Cons:I really don't see any cons, at least, at this point. I will update my review after 1 month of usage.But I think they can improve the camera for low light conditions, and I expect that gets fixed with the future updates."
214,nazeer,Expectation vs reality. 3 star product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had a very bad luck with Nord..Phone design and looks-5starBattery - 3 star gets heated up and drains fastCamera - 2 star definitely not good , night view is horrible.Charging - 5 star , 100% in 35 minPrice- very high , 3 star.No headphones jack, no wifi direct,no expandable memory,  no 5g .I had to return this product.10 star for Amazon service. Refunded post inspection  and very humble reps.Regards. A true prime customer."
215,Bharat Baban Avhad,Don't buy Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus nord is not good as well as expecting things which is not having one plus' own oxygen osNord having stock android ,its not good os which is I had already used with Nokia 6.1 plus it unsatisfied and frustratingThat's why I'm changing my phone but bad luck and wastage of moneyI requested to Amazon team don't misguided to common peoples through yours purchasing ad, there is seen oxygen Os but instead of oxygen os stock android provide please.... don't do thatPlease change ur selling policy and declared in specification which os is working....It's very frustrating..now I'm going change that phone..one plus 8 from local market not from Amazon because bad experience... not only bad but also wastage of money 29999.00"
216,Saksham9888,Better than expected..!!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using one plus for the first time, and honestly i was not expecting this good build quality and fit finish.Other than standard things, display is extremely good, haptic feedback is very tight  and powerful, speaker is sadly mono channel unlike other oneplus which offers stereo set up but overall speaker is loud enough and rich in sound.Rest of the things are as expected, only one issue, which onplus didn't add type c to 3.5 mm dongle in the box."
217,sidharth,Overall a good Buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   The phone performs as advertised. Smoot and no lags or stutters so far. Have been using it for about a month now. Main 48mp sensor does well, wide angle is good when there's plenty of light. Macro lense I would say is useless I don't use it. Updates have made the cameras and overall performance better.Display tinit issue is present on my device but after few weeks I stopped noticing it and have attached a video also. Video makes it a little exaggerated*At first I thought it was just too severe  of an issue to let go but then you will just stop noticing it. So didn't opt for return or replacement. P.s.Amazon had offered me a full refund or replacement option.Battery life and charging is good I get about 7.5hrs and heavy usage 6.5hrs  SOT @90hz full time."
218,Soham,Great product and just go for it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this product on prime day sale for ₹26,500 and I would say it is worth of every rupee I paid. The charging is really fast with the 30W charger. Camera quality is not really great but quite good for day to day use. Fingerprint sensor works really well.90 hertz display is really smooth but battery consuming. just one thing that is missing from this phone is 3.5 mm jack, so Mostly you have to use Bluetooth headphones."
219,Venkatesh,One Plus quality is amazing had a bitter experience with Exchange.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus quality is amazing but Had a bitter experience with exchange . The delivery guy didnt hand over the new phone, stating that Verify your exchange option is showing up in the app. Please contact the customer care. After contacting customer care, they didnt help any aspect. I had figure out myself. On the day of delivery, you would get an sms, after clicking on the link provided in the sms it opens in the app and Verify your exchange option would be displayed. After that exchange was sucessfull. Amazon needs to train the delivery agent, how would a buyer know all these things. I had already paid the amount online.Phone quality is amazing and camera quality is good. Fingerprint sensor is ok not bad."
220,Avijit,Worthy upgrade from 1+ 3T,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using my OnePlus 3T for almost 3 years now and I still didn't feel the need to upgrade from there since my screen of that phone is gone. Being an OnePlus fan I was eyeing for 7T. But I couldn't justify the price for that according to my day to day needs.So not being a hard-core user of mobiles I started looking for other options which will fulfill my usage without spending extra bucks. And the day 1+ announced the Nord i knew this will be my next mobile. It's a fantastic daily driver with decent camera quality (unless you're a mobile photographer please wait for the Pixel 4a)Now coming to my pros and cons-Pros:1. Battery life is excellent. Getting almost more than a day with 100% charge.2. Display is fluid and ""big"" (do keep in mind I was using 3T for 3 years now so screen is a big improvement for me. May not be valid for the ones who has used 5T or 6T in recent times)3. Still love the Oxygen OS with the add-on features4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. I'm using OnePlus Wireless Z earphones which connects to Nord quite fast compare to my 3T5. Design is good though I still love my Gunmetal design of 3T. Don't think any other latest 1+ phones can beat that design (just my perspective)6. Signal strength is good too. Don't have any problems with my cellular calls.7. 128GB storage is plus.8. Already received 2 updates within a week.Now coming to the cons -1. Camera set-up. I really don't like the design of ""Quad-camera"" set-up at all. The kind of audience they are targeting with Nord i think it would be much more appreciated if they just give 2 camera selection with some good image processing software.2. Now talking about image processing unit, they could have done better. I mean night images are okay but it could have been good. If they followed the simpler approach like pixel 4A I don't think anyone would buy Pixel unless someone is Pixel fanboy.3. Next thing speaker. Again this is decent mono speaker but they could have added stereo one instead of macro and useless lens. People like us we don't do macro photography and never going to do it with a phone but we will definitely watch some videos and songs on our phone. But don't take me wrong because quality of the speaker is good but it lacks the base. Compared with my wife's 1+ 6T (yeah we got 3 OnePlus phones and one earphone in our house)Summing up, 1+ Nord is a good budget phone for those who are planning to use it on day to day basis. Good screen, good battery life, decent camera and speaker will definitely justify the price. Having said that it would have been a real ""budget killer"" if OnePlus opts for two camera set-up with better quality and stereo speakers. My take if someone is really into mobile photography then wait for Pixel and buy that without any second thought. But if you want a good phone and ready to compromise the camera quality then look no further. Hope this helps. Cheers"
221,Raj,Not a good performer,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This review comes out after using the device for about 10 days and the performance is not good at all. I have been using Samsung & Huawei for so long and I didn't have any issues so far. This is my first product from One Plus and it's really something that everyone should think off.... this phone is really not worthy to spend.1. Touch response is not good2. Sometimes it's stuck for a sec or few millisecs3. Battery life if Okay4. Camera is good
222,Vivek,Big no for 1+ Nord..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are thinking of One plus Nord then don't think and compare with other phones. It's doesn't make sense to buy Nord. By buying this mobile, I have lost image on 1+. Even 10k mobiles have better camera than this. All camera's are useless just to have grainy pics. Back body is plastic. Also have heating issues. If think of replacement which will never happen so forget about replacement. Big no for 1+ Nord.."
223,Amogh Upadhyay,A good smartphone which could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Clean, functional design, infused with familiar OnePlus controls, like the Alert Slider.Super bright, accurate and smooth 90Hz OLED display, with HDR10+ support and clever auto refresh rate management.Optimal performance is extracted from the Snapdragon 765G chipset.Excellent battery life even in 90Hz mode.Competitive fast charging.Oxygen OS with more features than ever. Still one of the snappiest Android experiences available.Excellent main camera performance for the class.Cons:Plastic frame; dual selfie cam means a large punch hole.No 3.5mm audio jack, no microSD card slot and no notification LED.Single bottom-firing speaker with unimpressive performance.The 2x zoom is no match for a proper telephoto and the ultra-wide is barely satisfactory."
224,Raza,Very Important,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Huge Thanks to OnePluse because You provide us the mid-range 5G Phone, And Thanks Amazon to Service.Honest Review - I bought 12GB/256Rear Camera - 4/5Front camera - 3.8/5Battery Backup - 3.8/5Battery Charging - 3.8/5Display - 4/5Sound - 3.8/5 (Not Very Low)Charger - 4/5 ( Cable is Short )Fingerprint - 4/5Processor - 4/5 ( SD 765G Smooth for All)Android OS - 4.8/5 ( Impressive)Ram - 4.5/5 ( 12GB available may be 10GB )Rom - 256GBIf you really Loved OnePlus than go For it 12GB  variant Don't think Just Buy it, And Thanks again OnePluse and The Seller who Provided Fresh Handset Manufacturing Date is after 1 week when I order..."
225,C RAMAKRISHNA,Best Budget Phone with this price range with many different features...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after 1 week of use. First thing is impressed with design, so classy and premium look in hand. Screen-Its so smooth, thanks to 90Hz refresh rate and display is awesome. Camera-Pictures are so clarity with 48 MP sensor and selfie camera is superb. Battery-Coming to battery i am disappointed, its drowning very fastly with video calls and works for a day with normal usage, dint try with games yet, but 30W warp charger charges phone very fastly, which is time saving. Overall phone is awesome with this price range with many features, i can say go for it. Screen guard was pre-applied to the phone, but the phone cover which comes with box, when we fix phone in that, the screen guard is coming out as it was not placed exactly...Thank you One Plus for providing best budget phone in this price range.."
226,prakash,Bluetooth connectivity issues over.. software update waste... Same issue im facing..,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bluetooth issue overe..  no buying bro... First check Bluetooth connectivity... Next order this mobile...Im facing Bluetooth connectivity issues.. no standing Bluetooth connectivity.. worth this product 30000
227,Kamlesh PS,"Great phone, definitely consider buying it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone freezes and restarts about 15-20 times a day. It disrupts regular usage - if you're sending a mail or typing out a text, you have to start over again once it reboots. It's very annoying if you're watching something or listening to music or talking to someone. Sometimes it takes upto 20+ minutes to reboot.The screen has some tint issues. The left and right edges have a very obvious red tint to it and the center has a green tint. It's clearly seen against a grey / white background. There's also a distinct difference in the area around the camera.Oxygen OS is amazing, the customizability, UI and user experience is unmatched compared to other OS like MIUI Samsung OS. The quick launch feature is great, it saves a lot of time for things you use frequently.Battery life is great, it charges upto 100% in an hour (charging speed slows down around 70%). Device is very comfortable in the hand, fingerprint reader is easily reachable.Camera is great, night scape and pro modes are very useful while taking photos. The case that comes with the phone is also very good, it has raised corners to raise the screen and protect from scratches.The Amazon return procedure is trash. It asks you to install an app you can't even use. The only other way to return or replace it is to wait for a technician to assess the phone."
228,surya,A fluidic android experience :),5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is great!!Love the looks and feel of the device.The user interface is so fluidic and nice. Oxygen OS coupled with the 90Hz OLED panel is the best thing ever.The speaker is fairly loud. The haptic feedback is good.Camera is good, not great. Sometimes you get really good images. Not a fan of the front camera as it makes the skin look too soft. Aggressive skin softening is an issue.The fingerprint scanner isn't the best thing. Sometimes it fails to read the print.Another issue I found is, it doesn't have an option to lock onto LTE network (only LTE/3G/2G option is available, no LTE only). Hence it often drops to 3G network at my place where the 4G signal is a bit weak. My moto g5 had no such issues though.To sum up, the phone is great!! Pretty gald I chose this device over the realme/redmi counterparts :)The software experience is far superior than any of those.Also got more than 4 software updates with many improvements over a month's time."
229,Rohan,Good mid-range smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord 12gb/256 versionDisplay- very good, 90hz is awesomeSoftware- top notch, flawlessCamera- the 48mp pics are very good, details are awesome, video recording is very nice with high stability... Front camera is good too...The wide angle camera in bad lighting had too much noise and macro camera isn't good unless you keep the phone very close to the object.Speaker- it's very loud compared to my old phoneBattery- if on 90hz then don't expect battery to last long, 60hz with normal usage you can get through the day... With gaming it will last 4hrs on average maybe a bit more... Anyways the warp charging is very good...Network- no issues as of nowMemory management- using the 12gb variant, it's managed multiple apps very nicely...Final say,If you are using a lower affordable range mobile (below 20k) and change to this, this mobile is heaven...If you have changed from mid range to this, don't not expect it to be the best, but it does do everything for its price range..If you changed from higher segment to this, idk why u did that...For this price range this phone has done good..."
230,RAJAT SURI,One plus is just a bliss go for it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earlier I was using Samsung a51 but I was not happy with the device due to horrible camera qualitySo I purchased one plus nord I have seen many negative reviews about camera in Amazon but I didn't find any negative about camera .camera is much much better than Samsung a51 so I am very happy with cameraProns-1. one plus brand hand in feel is so awesome it looks so beautiful2.Oxyzon os Samsung is no where near3. I personally found camera best under 30000 far better than Samsung A51 which cost 250004. Display 90hz refresh rate, I compare nord display with Samsung a51 Samsung was just laughing stock5. Charger is so fast within 30 min it will charge 60%6. No tint issue I faced stillCons- 1-battery drains very fast2. 3.5mm jack should have been givenOnly 2 issue I found for me it's bestI read many review that camera is showing bullery photosI did not face this issue front camera is bestSo go for it one plus is one plus no one is near"
231,Gokulkrishna P V,Tint Issue,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the phone on Aug 4 since I pre-booked on July 28. I was really happy to receive the phone that early while others where still waiting. Buy after few hours of usage, I was struck with the issue which can be seen below in these images. So opted for return. I tested most of the aspects before the return was picked.Camera is Good for a phone like this. I also didn't feel like using a OnePlus 8 cam. Maybe the image processing is different in this one?Battery is kinda okey, nothing to boast about. Moderate usage can give you upto one day backup.Now the good parts :Videos are quite good90Hz is nice to useBuild quality is pseudo premium!(The plastic border lowers our confidence)On screen Fingerprint sensor is fast and responsiveFront cam (main) is nice. Way better than OP 8Front wide angle gives soft images and is pretty bad at low light(Same with Rear Wide angle)Nightscape is great!Warp charging is the best!And Finally the OS! No words to express its awesomeness!"
232,Kuber,Affordable & Best Performance 5G mobile,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Totally satisfied with product build quality, Performance & Sound, One plus delivered a good product in this price range. Thanks to Amazon for delivering the product in 4 days 😍😍Pros :1. value for money,2. Build quality, design was good.3. Very light weight & easy to carry, weightless4.

Gaming was superb, PuBg was smooth to play only in HD.Cons :1. No memory card for Extension of storage2. No 3.5mm audio jack, you have to buy Type C connector to audio output3. Battery capacity was low, it should be 4500 or 4700 mah, heavy usage it was last for one day only.4. PuBg was not available in UHD"
233,Pramit Bardhan,Bad Experience,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was expecting something good in this product, but it is a bad experience. This is the second handset i am using , first one I've returned because of some network, bluetooth and sensor issue.  Then again i ordered another one . I am using this handset from last 2 weeks , getting so many issues , like call recording, loudspeaker , bluetooth and sensor issue. Bluetooth issue is the main issue, where it disconnects automatically."
234,akr,Fantastic,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Features I liked:1. Smooth Oxygen OS,2. Satisfactory performance of Main camera lens,3. Amoled display- always On display support,4. Feels premium in hand,5. OIS support in Camera,6. Warp charge7. No battery issues- easily last more than full day,8. Night mode in camera comparable to Gcam,9. 5G support,10. In display fingerprint sender smooth,11. Very good quality charger & cable.. Everything is good except below:1. No OnePlus dialer & messaging apps- The Nord has Google dialer, & Google Messaging apps.2. Difficulty in call recording- As there is no OnePlus dialer app, call recording is done using Google dialer app, which speaks loudly audible to both sides ""your call is being recorded"". Third party apps also don't support call recording in Android 10.3. Macro lens poor as of now, but hope to get better with future updates.4. Face unlock doesn't work in dark."
235,RANJEET SARKER,A Pro device for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This device feels like half the Samsung alike shell with Oneplus Feature sprinkles.My experience:1. Display: An appropriate size display with 90Hz Amoled. Display is quality enough match almost to flagship.2. Processor: Powerful enough to forget about flagship device is not my hand. With future proof 5G modem.3. Ram & Storage: With 12GB with 256GB enough for more than daily driver device.4. Camera: It is Midrange+ almost goes to OP8.5. Battery : More than 4000mah battery justify enough. At first battery draining going. But with updating update it got fixed.6. Price: At this price device seems a little much. For me I got Over+ budget price.7. Software: Oxygen os is the best skin you could in the market. And weirdly enough they exchanged from Dolby to Dirac Audio. It is good to stick with Dolby. With 3 years software support smooth & speaker sound is very good.Final thought : At this price enough of a device. It little hurts without the 3.5 mm jack. This device is already recommended to a friend.
236,Naik L,Well balanced and justified for 30k,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus NordIn my opinion, Nord is a very well balanced well structured phone that will give best results..and justified for 30k for 12GB/256GBAfter one week of my experience...... Here I listed some points which came in my mind....Pro's1. Fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate2. Oxygen OS...Bloatfree/Ad free/Clean/Smooth with regular bug fixes and atleast 2,3 years OS udpates3. Fingerprint Scanner (upto 5 can b registered)/Face Unlock are very very fast4. Camera....Full marks for OIS/EIS... With the help of these, it will take good and natural (not like other phones as filtered) images in day time and NightScape mode is good... 4K Video recording are too good in front and rear...and 4K 60FPS in front is very helpful for Vloggers5. Because of Gorilla Glass V5 in front and backside mobile will look catchy6. Light weight and easily can operate with single hand7. Alert Slider button is at its best8. No heating issue till now (doesn't tried high end games but if play mid level games for hour, it doesn't feel any heat)9. Fast Charging....53 min took for 100%10. No need to download any 3rd party app, these are came inbuilt only....Hidden Space (To hide an app), Lock Box (To hide any Videos, Images, Files etc), App Lock (To lock any apps), Parallel Space (To operate 2nd account) and Screen Recorder (To record screen operations in high quality)11. NFC, Cast Screen, Nearby Share options are there12. Several modes are there to help customization and battery optimization... Dark mode, Night mode, Reading mode, Zen mode, Bed time mode, Work mode, Life mode and Focus mode13. Inbuilt RAM optimisation is there14. Split Screen option is available15. SD 765 almost equally works like SD 8 seriesCon's1. Camera issues in low light2. Absence of stereo speaker and place3. Absence of 3.5 jack4. No external SD card slot5. Inbuilt dailer app (No automatic call record option if u record call a warning will goes to other side person...you cannot search a unknown number from dailing last digits in recent call list)6. Normal battery life....if you use heavy will get 5, 7 hrs SOT, otherwise easily come 1 or 1.5 day7. No notification indicator, but ambient display will help in that8. Absence of Dolby Atmos9. Plastic frame (But because of this phone feels light weight)10. Proximity Sensor is little slow (What i feel)11. After ending of incoming call , fingerprint doesn't work (2, 3 times only till now)12. Automatic Bluetooth connection problem (Sometimes)13. Some people complaining about Tint issue...but I didn't noticed14. Company saying 5G connectivity, but I dont think that it will not help now, because still 5G not rolled out in India"
237,Mukul,Camera quality poor,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Never could have thought that a phone by one plus that too launching in 2020 could be such a disappointment. Phone is ok in all aspects but it falls flat when it comes to camera . I can't believe how poor it is . I would suggest others to please take note before you think to buy this . Phone will perform as generally one plus phones does but camera quality will probably break your heart too.
238,aniket mishrikotkar,Probably the best daily driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its simply awesome. The device feels premium. Yeah there are issues with the battery and camera but I am sure those will be fixed in future updates. Warp charging is insane. So does the screen. Oxygen OS feels simple and elegant. Overall the phone is a great mid ranger. If they can fix all the issues in upcoming OTAs then it will be a huge success.
239,muzammil,Faulty product. No replacement,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Such a cheap product from one plus brandPhone is faulty and they dnt have a service center in my city.Instead of replacing , they are asking me to visit the service center which is in another city.This is insane.Why to ship to city, which has no service centres.Just grabbing customers money, zero service from Amazon and one plus.Amazon simply pushing it to one plus."
240,Amazon User,It's good,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using the phone for a week. First two days, the battery used to drain pretty fast. I wasn't even using the phone continuously and was wondering if I got a faulty piece. But it got better now. I'm satisfied with the camera quality as well. I might not be able to give a proper explanation on pros and cons, but I assure you that it's worth the money."
241,Pradeep,"Delayed delivery, ordered on 28th July and received on August 12th",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is very good for my usage;  the battery is withstanding for around 1.5-2 days which is more than sufficient. Phone usage is very smooth and bloat-free. I am the kind of guy who installs all kinds of apps to try it out. Not a photo geek, so cannot review much on camera quality. If you are looking at a good budget phone with one plus branding go for it."
242,Aaron Chameilo,A GOOD BUY FOR THE WOKE CONSUMER,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been on using this phone for a good two weeks now and have been following every issue and product review of this phone including going through the entire Amazon section review for this phone. And my opinion boiling down being that OnePlus Nord is a good reliable phone. It won't fetch the highest benchmark scores or blow you away with any exceptional feature, that's a given. However, the experience is as promised with Oxygen OS onboard and the over-all performance you get out of this phone will not disappoint if you have your expectations calibrated to the price and the hardware that the Nord packs. The price point that the Nord comes at is in a sensitive range with a full spectrum of higher spec'd phones and excellent one trick-ponies in this range to the Nord, but it should also be remembered that Nord was never intended to be a Spec Beast nor deliver anything particularly exceptional, but rather it was tailored to the point to deliver the optimal OnePlus experience within the aforementioned price range. The optics, display, built and all other aspects have been all accounted for within my period of usage and I have 10/10 faced each pro and con respectively, except for extreme cases of defunct or flawed pieces..A general rule of thumb to also remember being that users moving in from higher end phones with an exceptional quality or feature will most definitely see the non-flagship performance of the Nord and that people moving to the Nord from lower end phones will also most definitely too experience everything in new light in lieu of the upgrade, so it would be good remember the conditionality of instance being reported from users..The OnePlus Nord is a good phone and it delivers fully according to its capabilities. Nothing is exceptional but nothing is garbage. Except for the 2MP rear Macro Cam sadly haha but that being said is foresable given the mixed bags that companies have to pick and choose from. I'm most happy with how the Nord functions and in absolute tune with the reality of what the Manufacturers intended to deliver to us users. Solid 9/10 for what it is was intended to be..P.S. People Concerned about the Green Tint and Display Issues should definitely check out KDCloudy's video on YouTube about the ""OnePlus Nord/OnePlus 8 Pro Display Issues"". It does a good job in explaining the nuances of the whole fiasco being faced."
243,Sagar Sanap,Best midranger at this moment,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The OnePlus Nord feels premium to touch and the weight is well-balanced. The handset is easy to grip and feels very compact to hold. Camera bump is huge, frame is plastic but doesn't feel like it.There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack so had to purchase a Bluetooth headset worth 2k.OnePlus retains the slider button however it's not being used as WFH.OnePlus seems to have made no compromise with the display, a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. Having said that, the device feels a bit longish and it will take some to get used to the form factor.It’s a delight to watch movies or stream content on the device. The colours are vivid but sunlight legibility is no good even with max brightness.The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors. The front camera produces good quality selfies.The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest in the business.About the performance, this device does well when it comes to gaming (CODm) and multitasking. While gaming, expect the device to get warm but it will not slow down the phone. Overall, the device manages to offer a smooth experience without any software hiccups or app crashes. For average users, who are into occasional gaming, the Nord will easily take care of all your performance demands.The WarpCharge 30T is a delight as you can get around 50% battery time by charging the battery for 25 minutes and reaches 100% within an hour for me. Battery lasts longer, refer the screenshots (taken over a month since I got the phone).The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.I got it for 26.5k with HDFC discount on Prime Day sale and at this price it's a value for money purchase."
244,Mahesh.P,It is a good daily driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's one of best phones available in the market at this price.But there are some pros and cons on this which I will be discussingPros:1.The software experience is one of the best in this price it's best after the stock android oxygen os is best.2.The display is best on this phone it's amoled display with 90 Hertz it's very smooth.3.The battery performance is very good on this device it will not disappoint you it's very it's 4415 amh battery and then comes the fast charge 30t it's one of the best charges the in less than 70 min.4.The haptics are very good on this device the touch sampling rate is very good.5.Camera performance is good but their are some cons which I will be discussing later on the primary and ultra wide cameras are good.6.Then the speakers are good on this device all though it's not stereo speakers the sound is very but not so clear.Cons:1.The first con is camera though it has very good night scape and primary and ultra wide camera but their are two cameras at bottom one 5mp depth which is not working and 2mp macro camera which is pretty useless and not of use it is very disappointing part of the phone.Their are doing a lot of gimmick of quad camera but we are only using first two cameras I was not expecting this from OnePlus this was very disappointing.But if you use OnePlus bullet wireless Z it's very good which I am currently and I One Plus buds will also work good with this device.2.Then their is no 3.55mm headphone jack as they are saying this a budget but not having headphone jack this is very disappointing as they have sell one plus buds they didn't gave 3.55mm jack it's all marketing crap of their own products.3.Then if you are a gamer I would not suggest you this phone as this device sucks in pubg it's not at all good as compared to its competitors like k20pro.So don't buy this device for gaming you will be disappointed.So that's all it's a very good device at this price point and it's future proof also as its has 5g compatibility so a very good daily driver.
245,Vishesh mehta,Disappointing ! Bad camera bad battery !,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  A very poor product from one plus , the battery drains very fast , the warp charger is not so fast . The camera whichbis the highlight of this phone is the real dissaponment . The back camera clicks shaky pictures 8 out of 10 pict are blurry . I was using mi note 8 pro before this on the same usage I had 45% battery left in it by the end of the till 9pm . The one Nord died at 5pm . It's a let down I think Goole 4a would have been a better choice . Really disappointed with the product . Wanted to return it . No return policy only replacement available ."
246,Ashish,This phone is superb but missing some trademark features of One Plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Purchased One Plus Nord 12 +256 varient.The phone looks classy and premium.Voice quality is superb. The processor speed is amazingly fast and it should be with 12 gb.Already got 2 updates which claims to improve battery efficiency and macro picture quality.Yes,the battery drains little bit faster but it gets charges exceptionally fast so no regrets.it charges to 80% within 45 mins. camera is much better in selfie and for close pictures.detailings are also fine.Night mode is little bit average but overall if u compare in such range then it's far better than others.In my view it is a good choice to buy this phone in 30k bucks.you are getting everything which is in one plus 8 and even more if u talk about camera.Only thing the basic screen while calling and some other basic things which are trademark of one plus is changed...it should be there.the oxygen OS is great and will be best if u give everything which is available in one plus series oxygen OS."
247,Amazon Customer,Good Android experience with avg camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  They really hyped this particular model. I bought it in prime day sale. I was using Galaxy S9 earlier so I was happy with Oneplus android experience since it's near to stock android experience, not big fan of customized UI since they add so many bloatware.But for this price range, I am not happy with the camera, the post-processing of the image really takes away the sharpness of the photo, and it does not look clear, I tried with both 12MP and 48 MP but results are almost same.Regarding the screen tint issue, Yeah I noticed it only during the night time when the brightness was almost 0 and screen refresh rate is 90hz and the background is totally black, if you change it to 60Hz then you won't see that also, so I won't say it is an issue. I did not observe it throughout the day.Battery life is good and charging is so fast.So Overall it is a good phone but if you are looking for good quality photography then I won't recommend it."
248,Anusree,A good value for the money with an average camera and questionable battery performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't know what to feel about the phone. It is a comfortable mid Ranger and definitely a run for your money if you want the right things. This maynot be the one for you if you need a good lense or if you need a super fast processor. It provides an alrighty experience and is certainly better than a lot of the other mid rangers and even expensive iphones.But I do have some problems. I am not a fan of any one plus cameras and this is no exception. Camera is just average. If you need a good camera, maybe you should wait for the pixel 4a. Pixel cameras are the best in the market.Another problem I have is with the battery. I saw multiple reviews claiming that it has a good battery compared to other mid rangers and some expensive samsung phones. But I cannot feel it. I feel like it's draining so fast, I should keep checking it and see if it's really not standard."
249,Anuj,Gratest failure of OnePlus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery Heating issue, Camera is no way near the flagship. Even my OnePlus 6t is way better with just 2 +1 cameras. Quality of video streaming is pathetic. Audio through built-in speaker is bas and through earpieces are worst. In short, OnePlus nord is no probably the gratest failure of OnePlus brand. Other models of OnePlus are way way better."
250,prakash Akerkar,Worth Buying Oneplus Nord in mid range segment !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well I am not so much techy guy who can answered all detailed query but i would like to write my honest review about this phone. I was definitely waiting for this Nord (which was rumored as oneplus Z) from March. First will talked about its packing -- Its awesome !!! Device comes in black box embedded with Nord logo...very fascinating.Then comes to display - 90Hz AMLOED smooth and refreshing colors. No issue observed about display which was rumored to be have color fade issue  dark mode. So guys dont worry !! If you worrying about display no issue from device as per my opinion.  Oxygen OS best user experience. Camera - Front and Rear Primary camera both are excellent , with coming update it will enhance. Macro 2MP - Not that much good. Speaker - Mono but still serve the purpose ; sound is good. Gaming experience - smooth no glitches experienced, PUBG user may have different view based on experience. Looks - Its cool, you will not come to know the back cover is of fiber unless said. So overall experience with this budget phone 9/10. if you really want to buy it then Go FOR IT !!!  You will enjoy the feeling"
251,Shubham,Nord - Story of a complete phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am not a tech reviewer but I am someone who has used this phone for good 15 days.Phone has got- Superfast Charging (5% -100% in around 70 mins) - if you say there are phone with better charging speed, sure there are, but what's the problem with this, we are charging phone not participating in race and if you do not have like 1 hour of off screen time then it's not the fault of charging speed surely you need to change your lifestyle.- Processor (does all the task smoothly, from small day to day task to playing high ends games)- Ram Optimization (switching between app is like cake walk for this phone)- Fingerprint (it's fast but could have been a little bit more snappier,  I could notice only because my last phone sensor has a better response but that harldly makes any difference)- OS(it's one of the USP of OnePlus, very user friendly and interactive)- Backup (on my off day my avg uses are like 3-4 games of PUBG, 1-1½ hrs of voice/video call, 3-4 hours of Net Surfing/YouTube/social media, 3-4 hours of HotSpot tethering,  with such uses device keeps me going through out the day.)- Display - 90hz display surely makes the difference- Camera - does the job beautifully- Looks Premium - glass back panel and it's colour set it's apart"
252,Irshad C A,OnePlus impressed me this time also,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm really impressed this time also.... My Last phone was oneplus 3 it was amazing buy i really like this time Nord. Will tell you my few suggessios.--------------Pro:*Good camera phone (you can compare with oneplus 8) . Impressed in outdoor picture performance*Good performance*Nice design*Video quality is pretty good*Oxygen is the best*Stunning display ( I didn't face the tint problem ... I'm confirmed)*Descent performance when u play game.*Decent battery performance*Built quality is impressed----------------Cons*Low light camera has bit grains ( but it's not that much bad)*Gaming performance is good but can't compare with other oneplus phones ( we can't compare with 765G chip with 865 ... Look at the price difference also)*No headphone jack ( I'm really disappointed with this)------Note: You can't compare with High range oneplus Phone with this phone performance but compare with camera its pretty good . Note the price difference between other oneplus phones you can understand.
253,Stranger,Value for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you love OnePlus, go for it..you will not get disappointed..I didn't saw any tint issue while 2 days of usage.. ofcourse the competition models are giving better specs, but this is the most compact..loving it..camera is okay compared to others in my opinion"
254,Adarsh Singh,Balanced upper mid-range device with flagship Oxygen OS,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's a balanced package guy's.An excellent device for daily usage.A decent device for gaming as well as camera.I think camera should be improved in coming future through OTA's.Overall 4.5/5 from my side :-)
255,seno,"An awesome, decent and budget mobile.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  A decent phone with smooth performance. I am not a heavy user of games, movies etc. This phone met most of my needs. Video quality and stabilisation are excellent. Pictures are good. Grey onyx look is amazing. Charging speed is extraordinary. I have not faced any tint issue. Overall I am satisfied. Should see if it stands amazing for longer time with no issues.Cons : I have faced the screen getting into so much dust.. like a dust magnet."
256,Shresth Gupta,Best phone And worth phone in the range of 30K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  • Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is average.macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is good.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it.*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)"
257,Kunal Biswas,Nice handy phone but issue in images,4.0 out of 5 stars,  It's good phone for regular uses. Os is great. 90 hz display is great. But I don't like camera performance. It's so much colorful. Extra color in everywhere. I like natural color. And it also produce shakey images if you click and shake hand in a second. But other than this the phone is nice choice.
258,Manpreet Singh,Not Satisfactory Phone,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hello ALl,i purchased this phone of top varient with 12GB RAM and 256 GB ROM. However, phone's performance was not satisfactory. After my data transfer from old phone I started to use it full fledged. With no games and no movies watching and using the phone for youtube, facebook and office emails battery did not lasted for more than 8-10 hours. Fast charging was working though, but then i need to plugin again and again. It started to give me worries when during the phone calls when i used to receive, it did not worked well. either it was a UI problem or something, but there i saw performance lag while picking up a call or disconnecting it.I liked the camera though, it was good and it gave me overall satisfaction. Heating issues also was observed. Overall I was still happy with my old phone even though it has a bit of performance issue.So i decided to return the phone which I am not satisfied with."

I have always been fond of one plus phones and their processors . Talking about 3.5 mm jack , then i dont feel the difference of it as most of the people today are using wireless earphones or head phones or airpods soo I dont feel the difference of not having 3.5 mm jack . Its a decent phone at this price with good performance for daily use . I m not a gaming person soo it hardly makes a difference whether Pubg or any game is good or not as havent tried pubg on this but overall this phone is good as compared to realme and xiomi"
263,Aarti Gupta,#amazonshowedtruecolour#Oneplusnorddontbuy,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Please dont buy this product.. camera is worst...

265,Piyush,ONEPLUS NORD - WORST PHONE EVER,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The worst phone ever with worst camera quality, not a single percent worthy. Redmi cameras are way better than this ONEPLUS NORD. Its not worth the amount. Nrver ever go for purchasing this, humble request to all the people planning to purchase ONEPLUS NORD.Even amazon policy is not at all good, they apply dual policy with customers, while purchasing they have one policy and after purchase a different one."
266,Suchdeep,Product is good but expected more from One plus,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Had bought it in pre sale, received on 2nd August.Had issues with Calling, the call was getting dropped randomly, solved by turning off Wifi Calling in the SIM Settings, but this problem wasn't being faced in previous phone, only faced it in this One plus.Also the Camera quality isn't that great as you expect from One plus, but the cost is also less so can't say more."
267,PS SIVA,"Epitome of Android device, otherwise buy iOS devices with your hard earned money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this because other Chinese offerings started to bake advertisements into operating systems giving you the message that "" nothing is free, you pay for watching ad"". Other options were iphone ( super stretch of budget for me and cost of accessories can get you another ad phone). I am a person who strictly believe that you shouldn't pay more than 35k for an leaky android considering what IOS and even a 3yr old iphone has to offer. So finally settled for OnePlus nord given the hardware at this price point : ad free Oxygen OS, SD 765 5G, 90hz led panel, opted for 8gb since ram is an old lpddr4x and not 5, decent cameras front and back, 30 watt fast charging, finally an accurate gps with NAVIC, decent haptics. Note : finally once again started to get notifications, better memory management, quality sensors like proximity, gps, no call drops with clarity calling,  after I ditched samsung a long time back for an Chinese cheapo due to the lags. Feels like quality samsung hardware with Chinese cheapos speed ( thankyou Oxygen os )."
268,DARPAN ,"Great phone, read the review.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"   Great phone by OnePlus. Amazing budget. Compared the Camera with an existing OnePlus phone, did not get me happy at all. The difference between the quality of the photos could be clearly seen. I don't know if OnePlus tried to fool us, but if you check the manufacturer : it's OPPO. And I could definitely say that the camera quality could be like OPPO less like OnePlus. The Camera is great though, it's not like you wouldn't have good pictures, you could create great pictures if you've already bought the phone or if you are going to buy it, please go for it without a doubt. It's an amazing phone with excellent features which would keep you interested in it for a long time."
269,hardik,Review for Normal User!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Here's my honest review if you're a normal user-I'm a working professional who doesn't do much gaming. Trust me guys this is the best phone you can buy.Sexy look!Awesome speed- you'll feel this everytime u use this phone.Camera is goodBattery is superb! If u keep refresh rate at 60 u ll get very goooood backupWhat else u need in day to day life from a phone?
270,Manpreet Singh,Very Poor display quality TINT in normal use also,1.0 out of 5 stars,  On normal usage mostly while the screen is white then while we shift our viewing angles there is a red-purplish-green tint which can be seen in my Oneplus nord with naked eyes that is very much annoying and one can not live with such a major defect so I decided to replace it as the phone is very gud in other aspectsI am still willing to buy it but I am confused that was that a issue with my phone only or it is a normal issue in everyone’s phone in every unitAnd yes the screen guard which came pre applied was also not attached properly it had many dust particles in it ONEPLUS should improve the product quality
271,Noddy,Smooth & Snappy - Happy with the product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros- Highly responsive as it has 90Hz refresh rate- Option of 12gb RAM- Decent Camera- On screen fingerprint reader which is quick- Stylish look- Fast ChargingCons- Battery drains lil quickly, but fast charging helps- Low lighting picture quality could be improved- Macro lens is useless"
272,ASISH K.,Call drop issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I purchased 2 phones and both the phone had hardware issue i.e. calls were getting dropped continuously. Tech team checked and the issue was hardware. Both my phones were refunded rather than exchange. Highly disappointed. I wish OnePlus had done network testing with all the potential network providers. May be some network providers are not compatible or do not support 5G. Serious issue to be checked.
273,Manu jose,Good package.. good user experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks promising.Pros.1. Snapdragon 765 works like a breeze.2. Software is well optimized for hardware.3.

Touch response, display are good.9. 30w charging is excellent no issues( only work  with the supplied charging cable)Cons.1. Macro camera is useless.2. Call recording feature is available but useless. It  plays a sound "" your call is being recorded""  when we hits recording button. Audible to  other person clearly. No auto call recording  feature.( People argue that this can be fixed  with software patch, but in case of nord one  plus won't change this google restrict the  removal of call recording notification sound.)3. Display is good but when u were using samsung  mid range before, u will feel that display is not  at par with samsung.4. No headphone jack (not a con) but oneplus type  c to 3.5 mm converter is out of stock always.  Other adapters available in online doesn't  work properly(significant loss of audio quality).Apart from this a minor bluetooth issue is there with nord. While using wifi and bluetooth headset simultaneously bluetooth headset will disconnects and reconnects automatically.( One plus promised update to fix the glitch)"
274,Sarju donga,Its a nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  So after 15 days of usage here is my review1.battery life is very good lasts one day easily after heavy use charging is very fast may take 45 min.2. Screen resolution is good camera is decent3.phone is slim and comfortable in holding hands4.oxygen os is very good till date I am using stock android phone but oxygen os is also user friendly.5.this phone have many inbuilt features which are lack in stock android.6.only draw back is automatic call recorder is not available but you have to record calls manually7.sound quality of speaker is good and loud.Final words if you are looking for good budget 5g ready phone than go for it without hesitation.
275,Alok,Phone is having network issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using Jio as my primary network in my Oneplus Nord for a week. Most of the time there is a network problem. The sim shows full network but Net is not working properly. I have to turn on to airplane mode and then turn off to get the network again. Please solve this issue. I am getting this problem only in this phone
276,Somnath,Balanced package of everything,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after using it for complete 8 days -Keeping it simple by asking you a question. What are your priorities ?There are many competitors to nord but none of the phones are a complete package.1) The processor 765G work great when optimised with Oxygen OS.2) Amoled display is phenomenal with 90hz refresh rate, fingerprint reader got no complains.3) Battery life is great (with my usage screen on time was 8-9hours) easily goes a day.4) Warp charging (full charge at 59minutes).5) Camera quality is not that great as the macro lens should have been skipped, but if compared to other phones at this price it gives a tough competition to other phones available in India right now (attached is a nightscape shot).6) Speaker should have been stereo but the mono down facing speakers are quite loud and produces crisp sound.7) Oxygen OS (big thumbs up).8) You don't need to worry about the build (as no one snaps a phone like Jerry does in daily usage), also it is quite rigid and weight is equally balanced.This is my first One Plus phone and I would say the experience is very good. I believe that this phone is a complete package by balancing every aspect for a daily driver. It does not have one specific thing as ""the best"" but every other thing as the second best, which adds to what a complete package should be.- Not a pro gamer, but someone who uses every function of a phone roughly."
277,reshma r.,Slightly disappointed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am not much happy with this purchase. The camera is one highlighted feature of OnePlus and I am highly disappointed about the same, there is nothing which standout in camera in this phone. Macro as already known is pathetic. Also photos when captured tend to be shaky and blurred at times, quality.of pics does not meet expectations. So ya after spending 28k on this phone, with the features that I have got I am not happy. But ya if you wanna go for the brand then ya you will get a OnePlus phone, but do not expect much out of camera quality"
278,Neeraj,Good budget 5G enabled phone but bit over priced.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Oxygen 10.5 OS is good and m waiting for 11 to be available for Nord.First hand experience is good and phone feels awesome in hands. Back color (Marbel Blue is odd one out) and side bars of platic don't feel like it's a plastic and gives you illusions of metal.Good to see they provide back cover along with box.You get extended warranty for red club membership on pre-orders.Camera is good but not good enough to meet the hype one plus Nord had made before launch.30watt wrap charger is good to charge the phone within an hour but battery brick is low on capacity. It would have been great if they would have provided 5000-6000mah battery. Battery management is good and have lots of options to save battery but that will reduce you premium experience.
279,Manoj,Worst Camera Performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered it on July 28th and received it on Aug 9th. Promised delivery date was Aug 4th. Nearly delivery delayed 5 days I didn't even get any intimation from Amazon.Here is my experience:I upgraded from Mi A3 to Nord, Mi A3 has far better front camera than Nord. I'm just wondering how I'm gonna get use of 4k recording with such a terrible front camera.Wide angle and Macro lenses are useless.Battery drains so fast even if you with 60Hz refresh rate.Few Good thing with phone is Smooth user experience, quickest fingerprint and face unlock.Think wisely before you buy"
280,shubhi,One plus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is not that good.. The battery works for 18-20 hrs only from 100% charge even when we don't use much social networking sites. It drains quickly.Camera clicks with good pixels only in daylight otherwise in dim lights it will give little grey colours. Portrait and nighscape modes are awsome.And apart from this, it is very very smooth to use"
281,Samir Baruah,Excellent phone for daily usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a user friendly, a value for money product. This is not the best or the worst , but definitely a very good phone. The display of the phone is amazing. I don't find any tint issue here. I have been using this phone for more than a week and the system is working fine. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock functions are very effective just like any other one plus device. Battery life may not be exceptionally good but for me one full day is enough. And of course charging is very fast. Camera quantity is good. However, macro camera is useless and in low light condition it's result is average. In broad daylight, the camera of this phone plays the masterstroke. Over and above, this is a good phone at this price range. I am happy with the purchase of One plus Nord."
282,Pavvivizag,"Great performance, well built, camera with ois, great display 90hz",5.0 out of 5 stars,"   The best you can get. Good price , great performance. The gaming performance is exceptionally good compared to any midrange smart phones. Display is amazing. Form factor and finish are up to the mark. Only complaint i have is with the quad camera setup.the primary camera (48mp) is the only good camera with ois, the macro 2mp is just useless. Only reason you want to choose oneplus over an mi phone is the UI."
283,Jay,Write a review after one month.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except camera, Everything is perfect for me. As I am just a normal user. Not playing gaming so much,so good phone for me. But as described, a flagship level camera, it is not as expected. Otherwise battery backup is good. Not experienced any leg. Neat and clean UI is best part of this master piece. Received 3 updates till the date in just one month. Very impressive. Oneplus try hard to improve quality of camera pictures by giving updates. But still not found any notable improvement. Hope in future updates, camera quality improved more."
284,Subrat,DEFECTIVE SCREEN,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   after using for 7-8hrs the screen got glitches all over the screenand also the shipping package wasn't packed with damage proof cartoon box, it was just the phone under the plastic cover, even the edges of the phone box were damaged."
285,shiva sai Mylarapu,Perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The performance, speed and style of the phone are awesome. Only dissatisfaction is battery draining a little faster than expected"
286,Amazon Customer,Worst mobile by Oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am OnePlus fan since launch of one plus one, but I had very bad experience this time with Nord. Very poor quality, camera is worst, sensor not working properly, charging issues, Display stopped working with in 7 days. I asked for help from Amazon prime but they said they can't help me , contact nearby service center. I went to service center, they said they will change this defective product and will give me new phone with in 5days, but after 10days  I got call that OnePlus company cannot change my device, I have to suffer with this poor quality product.My personal advice to all customers , Don't go with this project it's completely Chinese and useless. It's just waste of your precious money. Instead of OnePlus go for samsung."
287,Sagmax,OnePlus Nord best in Midrange,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing review after almost 10 days of use. Ordered on 6th Aug delivered on 8 th Aug, Good service by Amazon.Not comparing with any other phone just sharing my observations.12GB RAM and 256 GB storage and snapdragon processor so no problem with performance, AMOLED display and nice touch screen, feel good in hand.Camera quite good, on user recommendation Oneplus provided updates to improve vibrancy and accuracy of macro camera. As I am not expert of this department but completely satisfied with picture quality.Battery is 4115 mAh, which I think should be more but it last long for day with moderate to high use like 5-6 mail accounts, music, video, calls etc.. Not tried any games.Warp charging 4% - 100% in 70 minutes. Fast isn’t it? I observed battery drain almost 4%-6% during night without any use. Nord user asked Oneplus to resolve battery drain issue, hope they will soon provide patch to mitigate this.Oneplus provided lots of feature in this phone which are very handy, It is 5G enable but no use for now.Overall happy with Nord.If you have budget upto 30K I will recommend this phone.(Though you will get replacement of items but please read return and replacement policy of Amazon 2 times before ordering anything, it is not same as it was before.)"
288,Amazon Customer,Best mid-ranger with descent camera and good battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First Amazon return policy is fraud ,they closed return window in 4 days. So take careNord box look cheaper not like 28 k phonesHere's my review after 20 daysDesign:. handy lightweight and slim. Nothing more nothing less and good lookingDisplay: clear and brighter screen with good viewing angles.And tint issue is real, but not seen in normal usage.Back Camera: main camera capture good picture and vedios in day light condition. Night mode super. All other camera need improvement, macro and depth sensor is very bad wide angle camera goodDepth sensor sometimes struggled with cropping background.Indoor image qwality not bad.latest update done some improvements and need moreFront camera: not like 32 mp need improvement.updates clear noises but not goodBoth Front and back vedio qwality is super. Optical image stabilisation is goodBattery: good battery backup with almost 1 days in normal usage after update (90hz)Performance: smooth and lag free. No network issueOs: no ads no unwanted appsFinger print reader unlock fast. Face unlock very very fastCon: no headphone jackCon: little over priced. I think 25k is okI chose Nord because this divise very comfortable to hold and great os with flagship camera performance (little disappoinment with camera). I think more updates coming to fix that"
289,bimin,don't go fot it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  1+ is not a top quality phone to compare with i phone or sony.just like vivo /oppo.video clarity is good but photo not as expected.touch is not accurate..periodically this is shutdown automatically .heat issue in just a half hour use.little bit hang up for opening ,to compare with i phone /sonyAnd mainly one thing it's service center utterly flop,those who are depends vytla kochi, don't go for to buy 1+.they are very arrogant and bad behaviour, its service cost is very high,take a long time."
290,Rahul kumar ranjan,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a cool,classy and totally a one hand usable phone. Not with a big bulcky screen n weight, according to me it's the only phone with these hypnotizing looks in the blue colour in this price range. Camera and ram management is above the marks obviously but battery is just descent not that much gud not too bad.Looking for a classy phone under 30k so go for it."
291,vishal,Loudspeaker bursting .. disappointed.. received one plus nord with defect,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Have got a new one plus nord a week late.... And loudspeaker needs repair.It's sound is bursting.And I am struggling finding the one plus service center..Dint expect this in a new product . Highly disappointed.
292,Arun l.,Premium feeling with satisfied features,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Honest review after 2 weeks of use. Absolutely an amazing and premium phone at this range. There have been lots of comparison and negative reviews about OnePlus Nord, but for me it's the best smartphone packed with balanced features. No other phones gives u premium feeling as OnePlus Nord at this range. Battery life, camera quality and performance all well above average and not to forget the quick warp charge that adds to the boost. And it is getting even better with updates, thanks to OnePlus and it's software oxygen os, highly recommend guys. If you think other phones gives u better performance, don't forget they charge you extra cost also."
293,Ashok Ramakant,Great phone with a few hiccups,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great looking phone. I never thought I would ever own a blue coloured phone, but this color looks really goodScreen tinting / rainbowing is definitely present at low brightness but didn't really bother me. The screen is gorgeous otherwiseThe charging is super fast, and I was quite taken aback by how quickly it went from 0 to 100pct.4g reception is amazing. My previous phone struggled to get a strong signal in several areas of the house, but the strong attenna on the Nord seems to pick up nearly full strength everywhereThe OS has a few bugs unfortunately, more than I expected based on the brand, coming from a Mi phone before this. For example:* By default the alarm volume was set up at 10pct for some reason and I almost missed my work meetings the day after I got this phone* Enabling and disabling Do Not Disturb mode leaves the ringer volume at zero percent, which meant I missed a few important calls even though my phone was not on DnD/silent. You have to manually increase the ringer volume even after disabling DnD. The OnePlus forums show many others facing this issue* Bunch of other bugs related to thisMakes me wonder what else"
294,Prashant Yadav,Nord post 10 days performance review.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using this phone for more than 10 days now i beleive i had tested it enough to share my verdict,It's overall a good experience using this phone with one of the best part is display and bad part is aswell (pointing tint issue in very low light) the interface is clean and smooth but there is definately connectivity issue with jio sim but it happened only twice in 10 days.No lag issue faced till now.Camera is improved after update (macro is such a waste)Warp charger is superr..Overall its good buy for day to day user to a moderate gamer."
295,Amazon Customer,Bad,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life is very bad plz OnePlus fix the issue
296,Dhikshit,Decent buy for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good productI can give below ratings for the featuresPerformance 4/5Camera 4/5Display and build 4.5/5Battery 3.5/5Decent product at this cost when compared to iPhoneOnePlus should at least provide ear phone connector with the phone since it doesn't have separate port for earphones. This product doesn't come with earphones
297,NIKHIN CC,Budget phone at a good price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would say it's a budgest phone for daily use. Performance wise it's really a good phone at this budget especially the refresh rate,  Amoled display and the Oxygen OS. Coming to the cons, Firstly, the camera is not upto the mark. Oneplus has not maintained the camera quality in this Nord segment. Secondly, the battery drains like anything. If you are using mobile data then don't expect your battery for a long duration. Full charge happens in 20 to 30 mnts. Apart from battery and camera, I am happy with the phone. May be will have to give a review in future depending on the observations."

299,Jigar Chheda,If Camera is not primary go for it.... Smart buy..,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Brought this phone on Prime day and got delivered in 2 days, since 5 days I am using this phone.Pros-1 - Light Weight2 - Super Fast3 - Very extensive use battery last for the day also with fast charge.4 - Touch5 - Single Speeker but sound is loud6 - Oxygen OSCons -1 - Camera 📸2 - if you use for game it tend to get Warm3 - Fast charge till 70% after 70 - 100% it take time.4 - Plastic body5 - Sometimes touch couldn't respond from different angle.Overall a good phone, looks premium but camera is main drawback, rest all is superb."
300,Anonymous007,Worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The majority of peole say the speaker is not good. I used to own an Asus zenfone 5z with stereo speakers, and this speaker is very loud, perfectly suited to loud Indian scenarios.I'm not fond of taking much photos, so the camer's pretty decent for me. Other than that, everything else works like a charm.Some people are saying the fingerprint sensor is slow. Bruh, it's an under display sensor. As compared to other phones with the same sensor, it's one of the fastest.The face-unlock feature is very reliable. It easily unlocks the phone even if you are in a completely dark room.The battery drains a bit fast, considering the fact that it's above 4k maH. But the 30watt charging more than just makes up for it.It comes with a factory fitted screen guard, which covers the entire phone, so there's no tension of buying one.The volume rockers and the other buttons are very clicky, and extremely responsive.And then there's Oxygen O.S.I would say it's a good bang for the buck."
301,Tejas Gorde,"Oxygen OS awesome, But mobile has some cons",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hello team,Mobile is overall good. Oxygen OS is awesomeBut following are the Cons :-my one plus nord Mobile battery drained in 8-10 hours with  just a normal use with actual mobile usage time 2-3hours.Auto brightness Functionality sometimes adjust the brightness to very low level eventhough slightly more brightness is needed for normal use. Auto brightness adjustments does not reach to require brightness at many scenarios in daily use. so I need to to turnoff auto brightness and keep the brightness to normal requirements.I hope that you will address the mentioned issues."
302,Amazon Customer,Read before you buy oneplus nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I think i might have been handed a defective device by seller rocket kommerce llp.Preordered it that was amazon gimmick and fooled me before i could read somebody else review like this.Rear camera pics have heavy color distortion. And battery bakup is down right pathetic. No games installed whatsoever but still the device does not last even 18 hours on full charge with just moderate use whatsapp and instagram. Tried contacting amazon but no use. Asked them to get me in touch with seller i.e rocket kommerce llp but no help. amazon said they dont have the seller information, contact,email anything. A seller using their platform and amzon dont have the details strange or just avoiding.?"

It is hard to find type c audio head set in market."
304,satwik,One of the best in its segments,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all no phone is perfect.. so don't bother about negative reviews..Nord is much more than everything.Battery draining is somewhat hight but here there is Warp charge 30T to charge it up very fast.And reffresh rate is everything.. even in 60hz it works very fine, no need to go for 90hz until there are more heavy apps to handle...Camera is good at its segment, if u look at another phones of 64MP Nord is the beast..And gaming performance is satisfactory for a everyday gamer.. but if u are a competitive gamer being a 765g it will be not up to the mark.Optimization is very fineGo for it guys if you love OnePlus and it's Oxygen OS"
305,Vishwas,Great device with right balance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is an overall great package with some compromises to cut corners from the flagship device to save cost. It is evident from the plastic frame which is considered to be less premium but might be a good thing considering it offers better durability in terms of real world use cases when the phones get dropped. Battery life is average with screen on time of 6-7 hours and charging speed of 2%/min which charges the phone upto 60% in 30 min at its peak. Performance is great and casual gaming should be no problem. Camera is really great if you use GCAM installed as can be seen from samples. Software experience is great and there is gauranteed updates for next 3 years which is a must for longevity of the device. The screen is great and offers fluid experience. The phone overall experience is positive with minor hiccups like stock camera app performance, gimmicy quad camera setup(Useless macro camera and depth camera), no headphone jack and above average battery backup."
306,Amazon Customer,Disappointed with NORD,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's my 2nd one plus device. I was using 5T and made mistake of buying nord. It's been 7 days of usage and it has already started getting hanged while watching videos, connecting on conference call and while taking calls when connected to bluetooth device. If you are using OP device already and want to upgrade then buy 7 or 8."
307,Jobin,Pretty good for the price!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a good phone in this price range. The user experience is amazing. The display is top notch at reasonably low brightness too. They might fixing the black crush issues in the display in the newer manufactured phones. The photos taken by the phone were very underwhelming. After the system update it got better but was still a bit soft where there should sharp details. The photos are usable now and the camera software being coninuously bein updated means it's only going to get better. The only weird thing are the volume rockers. I find them interfering when using the phone normally in my hand but that might be because I have pretty big hands. It should be okay for medium to small hands. I would definitely recommend this one!
308,Anoop,Not worth its price,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yes, the mobile is not its worth 27,999rs  + Amazon Prime 129/month subscription* Ordered on Aug 4th 2020, delivered on 19th Aug 2020, with valid Prime membership* Go for Redmi mobile which will cost just 15-17k* Camera at its worst.  It is as worst as the basci android mobile which you get for 10000rs. Expectation was more for this range and from One plus brand*brand value doesnt exist*there is only one back cover as against 3 covers advertised by One plus nord*Battery is as normal like other phone., which was expected to survive atleast 1.5 to 2 days minimum* Bulky and not slim* display is good*please see the comparison with Samsung M30, before you go for this.to conclude: dont  buy One plus Nord for 27,999. it is worth of 12000-14000 only."

310,Naved,Not a great phone at this price.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I never write my review about the products i purchase but this time I'm compelled to write over here.As I'm not camera freak so to me the poor camera quality to me isn't big issue. But While surfing on internet the phone sometimes hangs.Also the bettary drains out soon.And it shows no internet every time i write at Google search bar and i have to off the internet connection first then on it again. Now it may be my operators issue which is Airtel but it wasn't there when i was using Mi A1.Apart from this there are little things which really takea me off like, only white flash light and no yellow LED mix. Too mich brightness even at the lowest."
311,Harsha,A worthy purchase with zero Regrets,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is the first time I am buying a mobile of this price range.. I never exceeded above 20k.When I heard that OnePlus is releasing a budget phone I was excited and hoping it should be around 25k... It was 5k more than I expected but I was okay cause of the value and features it brings to the price...I have been using this mobile from 2weeks now. I must say whenever I hold it in my hand.. I go to another world.. I dont want to exaggerate but the attention to details even the very small ones make this phone a one to easily own and recommend to another...Final word: A blockbuster phone.
312,Ramesh L N,Software issue imy phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,  After 1moth I am writing this  review. I  Never wrote this type of negative reviews. Please do not believe all YouTubers reviews. Sorry to say this points. I only faced or others also faced  these type problems I don't know.1.One day suddenly all data erresed and got updated.

314,Sanjay Kumar,***,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera picture 📸 quality in night is far below expectations.Battery life looks to be good as of now with reasonably good quick charge.End up in Paying Rs. 6-7k extra on the name of OnePlus .
315,Arun Babu,HAPPY With Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My requirements while buying this phone were the following:1. It should be good to watch movies or series2. Good camera3. Play games without any lag.I am happy to tell that it has met all my requirements:1. As it has already been mentioned by most youtubers, the amoled screen has made it pretty good to watch videos in this phone.2. Camera is good enough. I am not a professional photographer so all I wanted was to take better clarity photos. Nord's camera has done decent job in that area.3. And about the third point, it's better than my expectations."
316,Saravanan,I'm a satisfied customer! Best and recommended phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect device for daily driver including all your official and personal needs. This is first phone in OnePlus, though the other variants of OnePlus quite higher range, this Nord is affordable price range with all premium features. The Oxygen OS is good and intuitive surfing experience, though it has the feeling of AOSP custom ROM and UI with other phones, but it is much better. And another very important impressive thing is Oneplus Nord developer team who is analysing the user feedback and releasing the monthly patches which is enhancing the user experience and much stable feature enhancements. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend to my F&F too. The camera picture quality needs more improvement as I personally feel that the pictures are average quality especially in indoor photography. Rest all good..."
317,montu lalwani,CALL RECORDING PROBLEMS,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Why there's no auto call recording feature? Every time we have to manually press to record our calls even the baddest part is the voice ""Your call is being recorded"" this voice note also received by call receiver. They get alert that we are recording there call. Is there any way to remove that voice note and to record call automatically. ? Its worst thing ever."
318,SANDEEP SINGHAL,don't recommend. Bad camera quality. Not worth buying for 28000,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This is my first OnePlus phone. I was expecting a lot at this price. Everything is good about this phone but the camera is not good. Not at all good. I was using motrola and oppo f7 previously their camera quality is far better than nord. I made a big mistake exchanging my oppo f7. In nord pictures arevlike just as clicked by an ordinary camera. Pixels scattered. So if you are looking for a good camera phone don't go for it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they don't have any return policy for electronic items. So I am a totally disappointed with my decision of buying NORD. It should be priced not more than 18000-2000
319,Rothin Sarkar,OK OK PHONE,5.0 out of 5 stars,  2 days of use problum which i face is battery backup is very low. It drains too fast. In one min Of use it reduce to 3 to 4% from 100% of battery charge and comes to 96% and phone little heat up when 15 min of continue using. Other wise phone is good. It is charge quickly.

321,Amazon Customer,15 days with OnePlus Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi EveryoneWriting this review after using OnePlus Nord for 15 days. I was previously using oneplus 2 and after lots of wait finally bought one plus Nord.Display is awesome ,the colours are very good and realistic.Camera battery performance everything is good .Played pubg for 3 to 4 hours no lag in performanceSingle spaeker is compact and audible  but no Dolby Atmos.Selfie camera is failing to take clear shots at night time in artificial lights. While in daylight images are clear.Apart from that Best phone from OnePlus in this price segment."
322,Rajdeep Basu,Worth it : but needs optimisation,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a good pick overall.Overall score : 8/10Display :9/10In hand feel :8/10Speed and quickness :8/10Software optimisation :7/10Camera :6.5/10Build :7/10 It indeed was a little hyped regarding the 4 rear cameras. I'm assuming everyone who buys this already knows about the plastic build, which isn't really an issue. The only suggestion I have for other buyers : if photos and videos are important to you.. Then buy the pixel. But apart from that I think this phone is the best phone for its price. Could shell out 5k more and get one plus 7t cos the whole 5g thing is BS."
323,Prashant,OnePlus Nord...New Flagship killer......,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally, one plus Nord is in my hands...It's super smooth, fast, camera is just awsome, sound of speaker is just perfect, no display issues, trust me...Overall it's a complete package for those who are looking a great mobile under 30k.Amazon delivered a day earlier..."
324,Vyshnav cp,Blaster Nord.. MUST BUY..,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Superb phone... Getting on to it..Display is awesome 90hz🤩🤩Camera is also perfectMy score 8/10
325,Veer,It's hard to breathe.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disappointed with Google dialer and Google message apps, not auto call recording, even truecaller call recording is not working. Number search in dialer is not optimise. Parallel apps support is limited to a few apps.Needs a lot to improve.Group selfie images are not correct, skews the background"
326,Mehtab Singh,Read it before you buy!!✌️✌️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the amazing device i have ever used. Previously iam using samsung devices which lags after short time of purchase (due to exynos). But this has the best experience and the 90hz refresh rate on amoled screen is just awesome😍. After using it for a month my opinions are :-Pros:-1. It is manufactured in india.2. Best display i have seen , neither great as oneplus 8 nor bad. You will get best screen experience. (4.8/5)3. Camera are just execellent, nightscape mode is superb and pics of front cam also great. In ultrawide mode go for in well lit scenes in low light it sucks. (4.5/5)4. Charging is superfast if u are not using it while docked.5. This blue colour is awesome and have best shade like u will never get it on any other device , its unique in design.6. NEVER face any lag in both day to day work and in games. As i am heavy user and moderate gamer.7. Indisplay fingerprint sensor is fast and never face any unsuccessful attempt as well as in face lock sometimes it take time just 1 or 2 sec due to baclight conditions.8. Speaker is best and its loud and clear but gets hot if u play music on full volume for 20 min. Earpiece is great as its very loud and clear.9. Most important thing in the phone is its UI and it has most clean UI (Oxygen OS).Cons:-1. It has snapdragon 765g but in my opinion oneplus should give us 8 series of it. But u will not face any lag.2. Provided screen guard is flexible sheet which i can't say a guard at all it will just protect your device from scratches but didn't in drop. It has gorilla glass which protects your device but always go for more safety.3. Battery drains fast at 90hz which can be fixed in OTA updates.Conclusion:-If you want a device that never lacks you behind in terms of usage and day to day work then it is just made for you. And if you are a heavy gamer then go for 7t. There are many devices available in market like realme x3 but believe me! You will never get a clean ui experience like this one really loving it.NOTE:-I suggest you to put camera guard also it will not affect your images. And don't forget to put up on a bumper guard. Provided guard is good but i think it will won't survive if it falls from back side. Remember safety is first."
327,omkar matkar,Best phone under 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nordThe best phone under 30k.Using as my daily driver.The processor is nice Snapdragon 765g 5g processor.The vibration haptics was appropriate and on point.The cameras were great in my point at start it was lacking of white balance and exposure but after the updates there is improvement in colours and all.Front camera is also great and sharp.But there is a slightly problem in battery life because 1 day I was using my phone in 60hz display it was draining the battery faster as compared to 90hz because in 90hz mode the battery was not draining fast but in 60hz mode it was.Comes to display,the display was great. With that dual punch hole cutout looks great and there is less bezels in all side.The in hand feel of the phone was great. With glass back and front and 8.1 mm thickness and 184 grams weight the phone feels light weight and sturdy.And 🍒 on the top oxygen os this is my fav part because the os is like stock and great experience.Overall the best package in 30k mark...Conclusion.For the normal use, for nice camera and for normal  playing games then goo for it.But if your are a heavy games player than don't go for this because this phone is for professional users and for normal use with stock like experience of oxygen os then go for this phone."
328,venkadesh,My user experience,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved this phone. I was slightly thinking about tint issues but phone was not great amazing display. best ever display in this segment. Very well optimized performance only this camera performance is little low and low light shots are not perfect. 4 cameras in back is just marketing term 2 cameras are usefull. I think oneplus will improve camera performance in future updates. Overall when you buy you really does not disappoint, you will really enjoy it"
329,Mayank Punjabi,Oneplus Nord With so Many bugs and issue,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Seriously Worst experince I know device is better and good but oneplus Should improve there bugs before lauched because Its come with so many day to day issues #Display Bleading issue on low brightness on Grey screen Camera bluring issue pubg reconnecting issue battery draining so much faster issue  ... !! I know One plus Solveing by time to time But my Qus is that with them why they launched so early when there are So many bugs first they Solve it then should launch then it be much better ..!! I feel like Waste my 30k should Spent Low and satisfied by samsung or instied wait fr pixel4A or Should go For Iphone Se2
330,Darshan P.,Only behind in camera perfomance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   One plus NORD is a very nice smartphone with 2nd best hardware and really good software experience.Display tinting issues do exist but won't be visible in every app but only in apps with grey background and won't affect your day to day usageBattery life is good not the best but will easily last you a day even on 90 hertz at moderate usage and even if you lose battery percentage the warp charger 30 does its job and give you 50% of charge in 30 minutesAnd 100%in 1hour.Speakers are not bad has good loudness, good with the lows but struggles to produce crisp higher frequencies.And the only thing that stopped me to give it a 5 star review was the camera who's is very bad not in terms of resolution but in terms of processing, ultra smoothing of skin, noise, photos looks like if it was processed with extreme beautification mode even if not enables but don't lose hope the sensors used are very high quality and because of this this software base processing can be improved with future software updatedFinger print sensor and facial recognition are also good"
331,Vikram Nayak,Almost there,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  90Hz, decent processor and extremely fast. Everything works very well for this price. Only downside is the screen size. 6.44in sounds big, but in real it looks smaller compared to most other phones out there.Everything else is perfect on this phone. Coming from a Samsung, this just crushes it when it comes to responsiveness and performance. Camera is above average with decent lighting conditions and a side load of GCam"
332,Ashutosh Das,Well within expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The phone is smooth because of 90hz refresh rateBattery is well within expectations as as far as camera quality goes rear is well placed as per value of phone but front still needs improvement in indoor lighting conditions.Overall good phoneI upgraded from One Plus 3T
333,Suraj Lath,Worst Phone Ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst Phone Ever: OnePlus Nord has extreme network issues. Every now and then when people try reaching you - they hear the message ""The number you are calling is currently switched off, please try later"". I've reached out to Oneplus team to resolve the issue but they only asking me to restart device / reset Network settings which only resolves the issue temporarily. They phone helpline number keeps ringing and no agent picks up the phone and email reply is 48 hours late with template responses like ""Please restart phone, etc""."
334,Saurabh,Currently best premium midrange 5G device !,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Design : 8/10. Missing headphone jack.Mid frame is plastic.Camera Quality : 8/10. Low light photography is not that good. Needs optimization. OnePlus 7T is much better than Nord's camera.Display : 10/10 I didn't noticed any green tint issue in my display and display quality is worth the price.Speaker : 8/10. Speakers are loud but mono speaker. You may not enjoy the speaker quality.Battery life is good 7/10 : I expect atleast 5000 mAh battery if I'm paying 28k.Processor : 10/10 blazing fast processor, no lags observed.In-display fingerprint sensor works like a charm.Overall 7.5/10.No doubt that some cost-cutting is done which is not appropriate for a brand like OnePlus, quality should be preferred while designing such phones.Its a premium midrange device so I expect metal mid frame and a good camera quality with good battery life.OnePlus is able to meet some of my expectations but lacks many important things such as 3.5mm jack, stereo speakers, metal frame.Overall a good buy if u want a 5G device under 30k.Hit helpful! Thanks."
335,Amazon Customer,Cheap quality from one plus,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  No words to say about the cheap quality.. I was using one plus mobiles for Almost 5 years( one plus 2,one plus 3 and oneplus 5t)  and this is the worst segment which I have seen. Camera quality is worst.. Finger print and battery life too is worst..Slow motion capture is horrible.. Too much blur and shake noticed.. I Definitely don't suggest to buy this.. Never expected such low quality mobile phones from oneplus even after paying 30k for 12 gb 256gb..cheap quality mobile"
336,Arjun,Decent budget phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First things first- it feels like a premium phone in a budget. You get what you paid for.Listing pros and cons here:Pros:1.The processor coupled with ample ram and storage is fast enough to carry your day to day tasks, no lags or hang issues2.the OS is smooth and clean(NO ADS). Dark mode is a great addition.3. Display is great, punchy and vibrant. It gives an edge over its competitors3. Sound is loud enough4. Very good call quality5. The first primary camera and second ultra wide camera wont disappoint you.Cons:1. Facing bluetooth connectivity and drop issues with wireless headphones. Two rounds of updates stating bluetooth fixes didnt fix it.2. Punch hole could have been a single one."
337,Bipul Kumar Shaw,Feels like much more expensive phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera quality is fine for me as I am not a camera enthusiast.Vibrations feel good.Phone is snappy and quick like a flagship.No tint issues.Phone looks and feels very premium.Display out of the box is a faint yellowish, but you can change the color temp from setting to get whitest whites.The pre-applied screen protector is not that good and my unit also has a small particle/dust below the protector so I peeled it off.Weight and size of the phone is awesome.Just a bit disappointed as I had very high expectations from the front camera.Phone will get hot after first boot but then gradually it will get normal and much cooler than normal temp or redmi phones.PUBG gives consistent 60 fps will gfx tool."
338,Sachin Narayanan,Worth the money. Best phone in mid range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent compatibility with the processor, high Effie in touch on both 60hz and 90hz. Battery consumption varies on the take being performed. I believe RAM utilization also plays a big role in bettery consumption. However, the phone has instant charging option wherin you will be able to plug in for 10 min and work for 5-6 hrs for very less usable inputs(again depends on usage). One in all, w great release. Hardware is intact! Camera is excellent. Look, feel and weight are to be appreciated."
339,Amazon Customer,Above all the OnePlus nord!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  OnePlus Nord is a heck of a phone. Got it delivered on 3rd of August. Just glides through everything effortlessly. Just press on the throttle and it launches into orbit. Cameras are just awesome. After full day of usage and listening to songs and watching videos for around 2-2.5 hours it has enough juice to last through midnight and sometimes next day. It also gives that expensive phone vibe. in hand feel is just awesome and this size is very handy and feels light. Not going to regret this purchase. And for haters no screen tinting issues at low or high levels of brightness. Thumbs up OnePlus.
340,Varun Nigam,Full featured Premium Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone gives a premium look when you take this phone box in hand. After its unboxing the first thing which looks very attractive is Red Card Membership, its cover. Now let's talk about phone. Very handy to use. After set up gives you complete premium feel. Processor is very fast. And if I talk about it's in screen fingerprint sensor it's very fast and face recognition even more faster than fingerprint. Phone is quite heavy as it weighs 180 gm. Alert button above the lock button is a very good feature. Body seems like delicate and blue colour looks stunning. Camera works very good in dim light. I will give it as 5/5 for everything."
341,Abhay Singh Rana,Worth for money compared to this segment phones,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm new user to one plus family but believe it's just aswm to be the part of there family.The very first impression is look the blue marbel wow amazing feels premium in hand n then comes the software which is too smooth compared to this range phone.The most favourite part of this phone is battery charging capacity it's gets fully charged in 30 min.
342,Bijo George Philip,Great Device with corners cut!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a well balanced smartphone - Jack of all trades, master of none.What I feel is due North, OnePlus departed from Flagship but settled down before reaching the true 'budget' segment.If you ask for any alternatives to recommend - Not much, but how about considering an year old flagship instead?Here is a generation picture attached with OnePlus X."
343,Mihir Apurv Ramteke,Awesome Daily Driver,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The best thing about this phone is that it runs on Oxygen OS, undisputedly smoothest and best UI available with ""zero"" bloatware.....Camera feels good, especially front ultra wide...Charging is really really fast, as we expect from warp charge....Battery life could be an issue if you are traveling but for me  fast charging compensates that....At this price point with 5g compatibility, its the best Phone available in the market....Stop wandering in comments, just place order :)"
344,Agathian D,The best I've used till now,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I always go for the medium budget phones... With the announcement of NORD with upper middle budget phones, I wanted to book one as soon as it's released..Its going good as of now... And the existing issues with minor software issues and camera quality are being fixed by regular updates from OnePlus...So hopefully the mobile will exceed my expectations I have of it now..."

346,Amazon Customer,Go for higher end or any other brand,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera is more disappointing.they said shakey free pics but it still blurs the pics.finger print sensor is very bad. Small range phones bettter than this.doesnt look like one plus . Snapdragon 765 processor not upto the mark. Slight lag while accessing photos or anything.If anyone wants to take should go for higher end than nord or go for other brands. No option to return this phone else happy to return. Speaker quality is worst.sound might be loud but not crisp.
347,avinash jangde,Pro Purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Purchased on amazon prime day my experience with Nord is very smooth till now .🔘Display loved it great as it has OLED🔘Fingerprint just amazing (in display )🔘Camera should be better but it is good.🔘Battery life very good give you 6-7 hr SOT🔘Performance  fantastic as it has SD 765G🔘Speaker - single speaker sufficient loud
348,Vinay Kadu,Loved It!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Good deal in this price range! Loved the phone. Decent camera quality.. premium design.. turbo charging.. excellent battery backup. Just found fingerprint scanner little slower compared to others but it doesn't matter at all. And yeah.. loved to read that.. ASSEMBLED IN INDIA🇮🇳
349,Palak Shah,Good Phone for the price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally One Plue back in the space of 20k range.. Nord along with its feature rich packing is a real good part.. Finger print is fast but not very accurate  1 in 10 times you need to repeat it..Battery is working fine for normal use, but if you are heavy on Games u require a charge more in a day.. but that's not a problem given fast charging of One plus..Camera is decent for this price range,Performance is very good thanks to Oxygen Os and Snapdragon combined with decent RAMALL in all a very good phone for the budget buyers in 20k range"
350,Giyas Baleeghuddin Ahmed,Hype Hype Hype.....! Don't expect lot,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Thanks to Amazon for Fast Delivery as promised for Prime Members2nd thanks to Hfdc Bank for Debit Card No Cost EMI. It cost me for 27k for 12gb/156gbAbout OP NORD : 5G network still not available, Camera average nothing new surprising, About Display like these u can get in any 20k below mobile Amoled with UFP. Apps like XShare XClub are from Infinix mobile. AR not compatible and no options for GCAM App install. Battery backup not impressive but thanks u get 30w fast charging. Go for OP 8 it's a best choice. I given 5 star only for Oxygen OS stock Android like experience."
351,Keerthana,"Happy Customer 😁😄,Just go for it 🤗",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, I need a phn for 3years and above and then I got to know about nord very well after watching many reviews on it, and then I dared to order it against its negativity just by trusting oneplus , and then finally I got my nord on 26th of august, Im really impressed with my nord. It is super fast and the display is amazing. As I went through all the reviews before buying, I checked all the cons immediately after receiving. I would to mention few things that i obswrved on my nord are:Coming to display, I dont have any tint issues & the display is soo smooth and very fast to access.Coming to camera performance , its is absolutely good and satisfied (except slowmotion motion at indoor has screen flickering issue and macro lens is completely blur,other than these the camera is absolutely fine at both indoor and outdoor).Coming to Battery , it is good bt not outstanding(On continuous usage , U can use it for 10 hrs), and charging is super fast.Coming to processor ,it is super fast and yes ofcourse it can handle pubg and other games without any lags.And I dont have any network ,sim or bluetooth issues .And last but the best , OXYGEN OS is just wooww.I also received 2 software updates till date and will definetly inform what i noticed from it after proper  usage.Finally I loved this nord and im absolutely satisfied with my product .I definitely recommend nord at this price range rather than other mobiles."
352,Saket Rajput,DO READ THIS BEFORE BUYING 1+Nord:,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Anyone Buying this Smartphone and is here to see the Review, i want to say that ""Close your Eyes and just Click the Order Now Button""This Phone is so Awesome from every perspective!Before buying i was also so confused, i watched tons of youtube videos,And many of them were saying that Camera is Average, Build quality is not nice, feels cheap etc etc.Just Ignore them, i have bought and using these phone for atleast 2 weeks..And must say 3 things are the best in this phone:1) Display2) Processor & Battrey3) Camera (except the Macro one)"
353,Emil,Very good phone for price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overal very good phone.Battery doesn't last very long not even a day.But that was not a concern, charging only takes 45min. So it's alright.Camera is really good. It adds a bit of warmth to all the photos, compared to samsung, amdni personally like the warmth, which adds to the reality feel.And fingerprint scanner is one of the best out there."
354,BENSON MATHAI,Good one,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is really a good one compared to any other one in this range.Battery life is somewhat ok sometimes it is getting more than 1 day if ur using just call and some net surfing.If u r gamer then the battery is not up to the mark only getting 8-10 hours with max 2 hours of game play.Camera The main sensor 48MP is good but it can't be used for zooming purpose if u want to zoom and take its only supported with 12 MP sensor overall the 48 and 12 sensor is doing a decent job .Talking about the other two sensors 5MP DEPTH sensor is good that's all not an excellent one.But the worst part is the 2MP macro I don't know why they included this sensor may be for the quad camera namesake, the most useless one this phone.And overall talking about the phone the processor 765 is futerproof and giving a good performance, simply it is Jack of all but master in nothing. I faced some hang issue with Twitter twice, leaving that no complaints until now.And the best and most interesting part is the oxygen OS, it is working like smooth butter.Overall the oneplus is good in all, but not a master in any section.For a regular user the Nord is ok"
355,Himanshu Kumar,💯 Plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Lovely🤗, sleek💥, stylish and Shimmery🥰✨ pastel design. Not even trying to use it as it would get dirty😅, viz. it's so like a Touch me not plant🍀😅, so clean. It's my first OnePlus devise, so instead of becoming skeptical due to so much critics by many a youtubers, I'd still like to cling with it due to its Oxygen OS, and clutter plus bloat-free experience. Rest no phone is perfect, even the Premium ones have their flaws, will still go with this devise and experience the magical journey with it.✌️🙂"
356,Prajwal,One plus Nord day 1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just got it yesterday,after pre ordering it on 27th July. So far so good. Ui is smooth. The feel of the phone is good. Easy to handle. The camera is exceptional as promised. Wide angle option on front camera is cool."

358,Amazon Customer,Just read it then buy it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader and the face unlock is really good, battery life is descent, when you start with a 100% you could play 3 to 4 hours of gaming and stil have a 60% balanceNow about the camera quality it's really nice if you compare it with others midrange phones but if you campare it with other OnePlus device then you will be disappointed still the main and ultrawide is really nice but the macro it not that good overall the camera system is niceThe performance is really nyc it's fast smooth and like OnePlus says the oxygen it breathes is really clean, gaming performance is too goodThe screen quality is best , that super amoled display with 90hz feels fast and feels premium.The build is really good Unless you try to break it like jerryrigeverything and this blue marble colour is soo good that even sky feels shame..."
359,SYEDISMAIL,Good ok,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All are good but I find battery issue in nordI have already used 1+ 5T,6T, no issues in that one day battery 20% balance of 3000mahIn nord 4115mah I feel it comes more than a day but it stands only for upto evening onlyFull day battery 0%😌"
360,Mohammed F.,Small Display issue... otherwise fantastic,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Small display issue is seen when we put Nuanced Dark theme on phone...that is quite disappointing.. Otherwise Nord Is Fabulous 🥰
361,sonu raj,Really u could ask 4 everything......🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.fingerprint reads very fast as per our expectations2.battery life is not too much but it's good approx one day by net surfing or watching movies ..... Bt i think battery life doesn't matter because of its fast charging .... Nord charges vry fast  approx 50 min take to full charge and 10 min charge is for 30 Percent ,,,overall it's nice3.camera quality like a flagship level ..... especially main camera is excellent work and nightscape is awesomeOverall it's a perfect package phoneU could ask for everything"
362,Shubham barsainya,Decent yet not up to the mark with high standards of OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am die-hard fan of OnePlus owning 7 and now nord. always appreciated their sincere effort towards making their customer happy with quality products,but this time around the Quality has been compromised by OnePlus.the screen said to be 90Hz amoled doesn't feel like one. Ufs 3.1 should have been included.Camera is worse than ever. Macro camera is of no use, depth sensor too. Although weight is pretty much balanced. feels good while holding. OS is as cool as ever. Charger is quick. Decent phone, cost shuld have been atleast 3k less. Below OnePlus standards."
363,Samit,The story goes like this....,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I have spent my three months of salary too but this phone and I am not satisfied now because I m broke but still I look at my phone and be happy the whole day even though i am hungry.Just kidding.....🙈🙈The phone is a wow for the price. Display and performance is the best in the price segment with 765G processor. Finger print scanner works like a charm. Internet connectivity is superb with 4g. The only downside is the camera which is just good enough to get through the day.
364,Manosh,Amazing phones with all necessary accessories,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered 3, not one. It's definitely worth the money. Super charging speed and display. I have been using Google phones all along. And this one is surely done a good job filling the shoes. Playing PUBG is smooth. The accessories are really good. OnePlus has made sure you do not need to visit ant store to buy screen guard and back cover."
365,Aaqib,Awesome flagship phone at a reasonable price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my First OnePlus mobile and I am writing this review after 3 days of use.Firstofall thanks to #amazon for fast delivery.The below review is for 12gb/256gb model1) Fingerprint and face unlocks works very quick2) camera quality is good but much when u zoom it to full capacity like it miss fineness3) battery life is good. I had charged to 100% and watched complete movie of 2 hrs online with hig quality resolution and 82% of charge was still remaining. But if you use for games then batter doesn't last long.4) charging is awesome it charged from 15% to 100% in just 52mins5) screen touch, 90hz refresh rate works superb6) no lagging was observed till now though I had played games like F1 race, will try Assault and post an update only if there was lagging.7) I like the zen mode a lot. As I get disturbed with phone often.8) Display resolution is excellent, I don't have much experience with other mobile screens but I really liked it's colours"
366,Rajesh Kumar Sahu,Not matching with their advertisement.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Before buying please read the return policy carefully. Both sides camera quality is very poor.Not matching with their nord advertisement.Amazon approach with their policy would have  done much better.
367,sahil pataskar,OnePlus nord....must try,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is great at its processing and never lagged while multitasking, 765g worth it. Camera quality is just awesome at this price range. I know there was some issue related to macro camera but thanks to OnePlus they never let their users to loose the faith in them...they fixed the macro camera issue with the update as usual. Battery life is at its best. Pre installed screen protector never lets you down, even gorilla glass 5 is hard enough to bear the accidental drops. Fingerprint sensor detects smoothly and speedily although no one can hate OnePlus fingerprint sensors😀. Headphone jack is missing but it's totally fine. Although i did deep excavation of this phone and found that there are some major issues related to camera quality like it blurs when captured picture is zoomed and also some problems with selfie camera such as 4k 60fps video recording takes efforts to open and power consumption of phone also have some general issues but hope so OnePlus will fix it with software updates."
368,Ayush,I am in love with Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks...I am in love with this phone completely.. I can say you wont find this kind of user experience in any other phone under 30K...765G + Oxygen OS is truly awesome...it's so smooth that you hardly face any issue..I can give 5/5 star to its display (Fluid Amoled + 90 hz) ✓Camera experience is better than what I had expected...I think back to back updates to fix the camera accuracy/issues worked...Battery performance is decent too.. what OnePlus had claimed during launch of this product its the same. It takes exactly one hour to fully charge this phone and with moderate usage it will last over a day...Cons:The only drawback in this phone is the speaker...it's not too loud. But with earphone/HP you will have an awesome experience..

370,Rishabh Kumar Sharma,Good midrange smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after 1 month.Cons:-1) Camera is not upto the mark, but Oneplus team is trying to resolve it by continuous Software Update.2) No stereo speaker.3) No 3.5mm headphone jack.Pros:-1) Very good display.2) Good Battery life, 9+hrs of Screen on time.3) Speaker has good sound even it has mono speaker.4) Camera is getting better.5) Fast Charging.6) Super of daily use, smooth performance.Others issues review:-1) No tint issue faced from starting.2) No bluetooth issue.3) JerryRig shows phone can be breakable with bare hand, but you are not JerryRig it is good phone not easily breakable instead of having plastic frame."
371,Nitin,Awesome Phone. Go for it !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone. When I received the package, it was well packed. So, no issues in that. Coming to the phone, it is an awesome one. I went through a lot of reviews about this phone and most of which were negative and not encouraging. Though they scared me to purchase it, but I still wanted to buy it and I feel that I made the right decision. I did not find any issues with the phone. Everything about the phone is just good. 😀"
372,Sairam Rallabandi,Is it one plus phone or a realme phone?? Stay away from Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a big fan of oneplus and using one plus 6t from past 2 years. Was really excited and bought oneplus nord mobile for my wife. My excitement finished then and there. Phone doesn't look premium at all, looks very cheap and plastic. Biggest let down is the camera, it shoots like a 10 years back phone and selfies really suck.If you're thinking to buy please Invest 5000 more and take one plus 7t.It is a better buy that this.You have disappointed many oneplus with this product!"
373,Akash Patki,Power that it can't handle and the theory of Return,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am One Plus user since 2016, and Bought this Phone after a Lot of reviews and a months wait.No reviewer, absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility.If you ask me features.. i cant say they are any less than expected. I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn't heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to ""Item received is defective/does not work properly."".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution."
374,Mohammed azhar,OnePlus Nord...worth a Buy...The New premium show,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received mobile even before sale started on AmazonSo one of the first customer to useThe phone touch is like butter and design is really goodI switched from OnePlus 5T to Nord ,so no issue in understanding the features.Oxygen is the beast UI in Mobile phonesPro's1.90Hz display-This you will understand the difference when to switch between apps, gaming and reading articles2. Fluid AMOLED display better than many phones in this range....compared with few Mobiles that my friends have.. OnePlus Nord is way better3. Battery life is just awesome.. even at 90Hz4. Design is very pleasing and elegant5. Camera- Rare Camera & Front both are good ...I don't use much still I think OnePlus must give update through which it can improve alot .6. Oxygen OS- Best in market & and best in class7. Warp charge is insanely fast wow....fast (30W)Con's (Mostly are expectations as a old OnePlus user)1. Side body being metal than bring plastic2. More colours, I like one which I have but would have being more delighted if could have got moon light black..Important Note:1.Many features such apps having dark themes,quick zoom to screen size, customize app icons, colour customizing and many more gives OnePlus mobile like Nord way more advantage than other mobiles in market even if they give bigger screen,better camera or battery2. Most important thing it will give to all Android updates for next 3 years....100% sure because I got started OnePlus 5T with Oreo (8.0) then I even got Android 10... So no other Android mobile company at present give this.#Oneplusnord#stayhome#staysafe"
375,dev,OnePlus Nord,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is good not that awesome it take around 1hr 15min for full charge , performance wise it is smooth and fast to use but I am really sad with nord camera I found 3 problems in camera first portrait single person mode click black and white image second worst slo mo I have seen third micro lens is bad . I seen one or two problems more ...  When you watch hd or 4k content there is problem of auto brightness and issue of display ( green and pink tint ) when brightness is low. Anyway it is not a deal breaker but overall I will give 6.5/10"
376,Rahul singh,Above average Phone; Poor battery backup,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life: Drains very fast, heavy users will get only 6-7 hrs of battery backup also charges battery 100% in 1 hr.Display very goodSound above averagePerformance excellentIf you need good battery backup please go for another phone..  Nord battery Drains very fast really fast.."
377,ishan s.,One plus nord is here,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great product by 1+, this is my third phone of 1+ after 1+x and 1+5, Blue marble color is catchy. Battery life is good,, oxygen is best as always. Camera quality is very good,got an update for macro camera setting, nightscape camera is excellent, did not face any issue of tinting in low brightness. Processor is fast and full charging under 1 hr.All in all very good phone in the range"
378,Amazon Customer,Review with 8 days usage,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  HiAfter usage of more than 8 days, I'm writing this review.Pros1. Looks n feel is definitely premium2. Fresh feel of product3. Battery life is good with mild usage, will easily last a day.4. Fast processor5. Amazing capability of multi tasking6. Oneplus os is gr8Cons1. Camera is okay, but could have been better, depth in pics lack original colors  though day light photography is okay2. Back finish is gloss, tend to slip out of hands so back cover is must"
379,Tushar mishra,what was the hype for? this for 30k?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  one plus nord lacks camera stability, takes few secs while capturing a photo if moved the photo becomes hazy, have to keep  the phone and object steady till the photo loads. havent seen such in budget phone as well. hopefully one plus can fix this with an update in future. one more problem is as the picture clicked from back camera has lot of saturation like realme hones it looks artificial.  front camera is worthless. i mean in atificial light where there is too much light above head example in big showrooms malls or big shops or supermarket where there is lots of light above you nord completely messes up the white balance i mean you can hardly see the background properly. even the colours come disortedi mean its not accurate. if you click a photo in such condition you will notice the face is filled with light and you can hardy use that photo. i dont know if this is happening in my phone or everyone's phone. only plus point in this phone is its haptic feedback and when you hold the phone it will fit you hand beautifully. no need to mention the oxygen os. fingerprint is average i think due to animation it looks slow. amoled displayis beautiful. charging speed is fabulous. i mean i recharged the battery in around 40 mins. backup is also average. overall its an average phone nothing extra ordinary in it. there are better phones at better price in market. hopefully one plus fixes the camera issue if so other problems can be managed"
380,sunil,Good one in 30K range ..,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Received it on 2 Aug 2020 ..Performance is very good ..Voice clarity is quiet good ..Device speaker is very good even at high volume with clear sound.CameraFront:  wide camera option is as good as described .Back camera : okBattery  : charging is quiet fast in half an hour my phone get charged from 10% to 80% ..With normal use .. such as WhatsApp and voice calling .. it can survive one day ..Overall a good handset in this range if you are looking for performance.
381,Pratik Pattanaik,Great buy if you are not into photography!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The build of the phone looks very premium, however, surprisingly it is very lightweight. It is way lighter as compared to my Redmi K20. Hence, the Redmi K20 feels a bit sturdy on my hand. That doesn't imply that the Nord is not well built but the on hand feeling is well a bit disappointing to me.The cameras are kind of okay. The main camera is the one that will give you impressive pictures. The macro is too weak. Personally I'd have preferred a telephoto. Again let me compare with the K20. The primary camera of Nord is way better. The OIS will help you click better shots with the camera. The nightscape is impressive (better than what Redmi offers). Now if you can find the right GCam for Nord, I guess photography will be sorted. The Ultrawide camera will give you mixed feelings. Even I can't decide if the K20 is better or the Nord.Battery wise it lasts a day for me with regular usage. That's pretty good. Charging speed is pretty exciting!The 90hz screen is a pleasant affair but I am yet to experience its impact other than while swiping and scrolling.The fingerprint reader is I guess the best in class. It's fast and accurate. I have come to love it. I always favored hardware fingerprint reader after my experience with the K20, but Nord has me loving it.One thing I love is the software. I am a fan now. I preferred stock android over any other skin. But, maybe it is Oxygen OS that deserves to be the best. This is quite stock-ish. I used an Android One phone and then switched to this, and I feel like at home. With some renovations here and there.The rest of the hardware will cover you for a complete experience. I guess a metal frame is what could have made it better. Jerry did Bend it like Beckham.So if you are looking for great cameras, don't buy this. Honestly, the Realme X series will fare you better or wait for the Pixel. If you are just a casual clicker then the primary camera won't disappoint and the Nord does tick all other boxes. I think the experience of Oxygen OS should make up for what it lacks. And it's a mid ranger so don't expect flagship quality. It is pretty well balanced."
382,SHIVAM SINGH,One plus nord is the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome camera and storage space
383,Sai sushanth,A seriously good experience :>,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I gotta say I was quite unsure on how my experience with a brand new OnePlus would turn out but damn this was the best choice I probably made. The feel, smoothness, customisation, performance is absolutely stunning, what made the experience even better was the fact that the device is seriously light weight better than all the other mobile experience I've had up until now. The GPU though Beast! I've tested it on the most heaviest game I've seen up till now though and I could not see a trace of stutter or any sort of lag. I used to find it in flagships lmao yeah Nord is that good!And yeah the camera experience is a little alright if you don't really care about it much but if you happen to be a camera freak then yeah this might be a hard choice. If you're a mid range gamer and sucker for fps and performance then yup this is the best device you can get your hands on! The battery life, yeah I haven't tested it much but I think it lasts about the same time it specifies in the battery optimization window, so there's really no issues there :>Make sure to get the best out of it by optimising to your specific requirements and enjoy ! I'm having a good time. Oh yeah and don't think twice before buying it just do it xD"
384,Amazon Customer,Camera is very poor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very very bad camera my 1+6 give better photo than nord, because of the camera specification i bought nord and one plus dissappointed me with nord.  I thought 48 MP camera give good quality of picture and i really dissappointed. Dont bye if you look for camera otherwise the phone is good"
385,Anuraag Mathias,"Seemless, smooth experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got it today. No display issues or heating issues as such. The battery will take 4-5 cycles to get to maximum capacity but I'm already getting good battery back up. The back of the phone gets slightly warm during the warp charging bit you won't notice it until you look for it.All in all, great phone. No issues during casual gaming as well. The processor is more than capable. Selfie camera and rear main camera are absolutely amazing. Just pretend the macro camera isn't there. 😋Will update with any issues if I face any."
386,Althaf 6.,Performance is awesome price worthy people are jealous at this launche of one plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using my old mobile for long time of 2gb ram and looking for a perfect mobile and one plus launched nord iam using it from 9 days the 12gb variant and the performance is superb camera quality is also good but I have disappointed at one thing when iam stream prime the volume icon struck at its place and it interrupt so much at that time touch was not working when I close the aap the problem still continues i have restart my phone then it was clear from that place same problem occurs when I am playing pubg Hope it will fix in update
387,Aadi,Overall Good except camera,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   Overall phone is goodFinger prinr is goodBettry life is good with 90Hz/ better with 69HzNo heating issuse found till nowOnly one problemCamera require some time to capture image and too much time in proocesingSome slow motion video , portrait selfie,night photos is given found good but it require too much times to proceess and save."
388,Dijo Daison,One love,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. You'll get 8GB ram, 128Gb internal storage (20GB is taken up for the OS) & 5G although you won't get a 5G connection everywhere yet. The performance of the device is fast and smooth af.Regarding the display, thers's OLED distortion issues at extreme viewing angles, ie, slight shift in color and temperatures at oblique angles of screen. But its not visible with non white background and  NOT the ""green tint"" issue  that everyone is talking about.  Though it looks normal when looking at the screen head on, blue glare stripes are visible as you tilt at extreme angles of screen affecting whites of the phone(basically any app that supports a white background)One point to note, it warns when you put in  two sim cards, you are unable to connect to a 5G network until they release the software update. Having 5G makes the device future proof. No lag on phone and ticks all the boxes decent cameras and it will only get better with updates from 1+. Included is a phone case and screen protector. It's definitely a flagship killer."
389,Bhavik Limani,Perfect Budget Quality Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  #1. The Color Gray Onyx perfect. OxygenOS which runs as smooth as they come.#2.  The quality of the sound as speaker in the bottom looks like an extra louder.#3. Plastic Design looks and feels similar to the metal that feels the premium phone.#4. Screen and refresh rate great as mentioned.#5. Battery last long full use in Game & Multi-tasking.#6. As a Gamer, it's good and perfect for mid gaming phone as we with the processor.The Perfect Budget Phone with the Camera, Processor, and Premium feel compare to other brands with the same features and price range."
390,SP,Jack of all trades!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolute value for money, considering the features that it provides. Definitely the the second best of everything, although I would rate the screen performance first class. After the first two updates, camera and power backup just got a lot better. There is ample RAM and processing power for your daily mobile chores including playing COD. Except for the oxygen wrappers and couple of oneplus apps, the OS is pretty much clean and neat.Still not sure why people bother to spend more than half a lakh of Indian monies for a similar phone with a logo of a bitten apple behind it :PDownsides -> I really miss the 3.5mm jack :( . They could also have included a telephoto camera instead of that second front facing camera (Just absolute waste)."
391,Mavana Vijay,THE BEST PHONE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life drains bit fast on continue usage . But Software is Amazing Osum Superb , design Beautiful . Totally Happy with Phone 🥰👌🏻👌🏻 Thankyou One Plus Nord ❤️And Packing and Delivery 👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻 . Thankyou Amazon"
392,Mahesh,A budget  all-rounder from OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a excellent phone , It's definitely a allrounder with gud price , everything is fine , battery life is gud..7hr to 8hr screen on time if you use normally like insta fb Twitter Play games for few hours . Camera main sensor is excellent and also wide angle sensor is decent, macro is okay. Front cam photo is gud and video is excellent. Screen is excellent amoled with 90hz and UI is excellent with already 4 updates came till now. OnePlus always known for fast updates and Oxygen UI.Performance is fine even PUBG and call of duty running smoothly. OnePlus will also give update for PUBG high ultra settings. No color tint issue with mine I have tried in dark condition check many times.No phone is giving this much of specs with price. Truly value for money comparing from European and US markets it's cheaper by 10k to 12k.Cons -Not a big battery but it's fine if you are not a heavy gamer ,plus fast charging is there it's handy.Macro cam - It's macro cam average ,it's not gud but they gave two updates for macro.Depth cam - It's also averageSlow Mo - No 480f/s"
393,jaishree verma,Not worthy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 8gb ram variant.  let's talk about pros ans cons -1. Battery life - battery drains too fast. However it has fast charging as well. But you need to charge your phone very often. For 100% battery it last up to 7 hours on screen. That's pretty low when you are into phone all time2. Front camera - picture quality is average. Not that great. Biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast 2-3 seconds. There's a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image. And that's really annoying. Another major drawback poor quality in low light.3. Back/Rear Camera. Picture quality is good, also in dim light.4. Gaming - pubg. It runs smooth with graphics5. Fingerprint. - i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all. Again it takes seconds to response. Arrgghh... annoying when you are in hurry.All over, better go for flagship phone. It is not worth spending money. I feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price."
394,Saptarshi Bhattacharjee,OnePlus Nord 12GB 256GB Blue Marble & Gray Onyx,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yes, got both the versions!Giving a review after 3 days of use when I finally had to charge the phones again.- Used for HD online game: lag free experience and impressive battery back up even after considering these to be new phones.- Great overall built and looks, more than value for money.- Quite an impressive camera but the 4-camera set up was unnecessary other than keeping up with the market demands.- The inbox phone case is a simple one but not too great a protection for the camera bump.- A few apps come pre-installed and might be unnecessary.The last 2 points may be considered a time-waster but not my fault, could barely find a legit ground to complain. Haha!Please keep in mind this is not a flagship phone but to cater to mid tier needs, for which OnePlus Nord supersedes though!"
395,praamoth raahul,Buyers read this,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Speed is goodRear camera is goodWhen it comes to battery life it doesn't last for a 12hrsAnd worst part of the phone is front camera not upto the mark @oneplus
396,Akhil,Satisfactory + one of the best midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Just received it.....and the phone is fantastic cum satisfactory ..iam not saying that it's not good I must say its awesome in some of its unique aspects ....Only thing is it's macro lens -useless lens with bad quality ..but Main camera isQuite nice needs some updates..but overall amazing ..selfies are the main attraction...Oxygen OS is love and battery is quite good... In this price range it's not bad and gaming is also quite nice ...Full review after 1 months usage ..okay then enjoy your nord !
397,Gajendra D,Not extraordinary,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1) If you are looking for a premium phone , OnePlus Nord is not an option for you.2) Phone gives feeling of OPPO or VIVO phone for which you need not to pay 28k or 30K.3) Fast charging is good, Camera of fine (not extraordinary)4) Display is good.5) Heating problem still persist in oneplus devices."
398,santanu sarkar,Review after using 2 months,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  On screen fingerprint reader is really slow than back side fingerprint reader, some times finger print is not detected at all. Face unlock super fast, works really good even in complete darkness.. Battery not an issue for me as i don't play any games (lasts for a day).. Camera quite good.. Google Chrome has an issue..sometimes search results doesn't show up.. Have to back and search again otherwise phone is running smooth"
399,Sayok,Do NOT Buy. Green tint issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  There is a green tint on screen of the phone. There ie a bar on the camera notch.The bix came in crumbled from all sides. Heavily disappointed in this phone. Please Do Not Buy
400,jigna,Received a defective phone which wont start,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received a dud phone which refused to start. Which was quite shocking given Oneplus brand. One top of it, the phone is unavailable now, and wrt to refund, Amazon pickup person wants to start the phone before picking up (which will not start as the phone is defective), so overall pretty I m stuck with a phone which is a paperweight, waiting for Amazon to resolve it. Very disappointed with Oneplus though."
401,abhishek,NORD fails to meet standards,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display problem, one Plus fails to address the obvious hardware issue and is just trying to fool the customers i should have rather bought pixel 4a check the tint it doesn't stop in grey background trust me it is very much noticable as a red hue on white screens too in the night. I feel that iff i use it in the night my eyes will get spoilt because the red hue is very annoying. Disappointed by one plus, didn't expect cheap product like this.Can adjust on anything other than display."
402,Meghnath Saha,Well nord is here finally,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The review is after 7 days of use..Well from the last few years I have been dreaming of taking one plus finally nord is here after 3 attempt online..So much hype in this year.Finally got the 12+256Gb variant .Here is some review of every segment1.Ease of use -Well oxygen os is something which is so smooth , always wanted to have its experience finally it's here..The os is so smooth and crisp..with 90 hz refresh rate you can literally run so many apps in background.It is getting updates every week so get ready for android 11 by year end.2.performance - As I have told earlier is is smooth and hardly you feel any lag.One thing surprise me is the Google keep application if you set in desktop and try to use the writing feature the phone response to it very late..3.Battery life - I am hardcore user.I used it as BYOD at my work..all the office apps from Microsoft is there, So many calls in whole day, Battery depending on your usage, I have screen time of 5-6 hours daily, the best thing is Wrap charging its the best hardly took 45-50 mins to get charged ..In the beginning it will take sometime to collaborate with screen ,daily use after 3-4 days you will have the stable battery life so don't get upet if it's drain quickly in first or 2nd day..4.gaming - Well pubg is banned but I have played some other games.. Experience is good.it also has that fnactic mode which disrupts background activities and notification it's good thing to see.5. Camera-Well I would rate 3.5 out of 5.you are paying 28-30 k but will expect something good..the macro camera is uselss and hope it will improve as per updates..front facing camera is good...The wide angle camra is lacking detail..Nightscape is good and portrait is good ..I will udpate as per usage in upcoming week or month.."
403,Harshad Salunke,Almost everything in good price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Onepluse Nord (12+256)ProsPerformance: 765G has its own sustainability rate. So in performance it gives you the powerful CPU in mid-range phones. Gaming is something the OnePlus Nord can handle fairly well, in terms of performance. Popular games like PUBG Mobile and COD: Mobile run at 100% stabilityCamera: it comes with the quad camera setup 48+8+5+2 and in front it has 32+8. Wide angle range is 119° for rear camera while wide angle range is 105° wide. It supports features such as HDR, It gives you a video of 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60fps, it offers amazing selfies, the quality of the produced photos is very good in both natural & low light conditions, the images, videos & text look very sharp & clear, It is attractive & fashionable.(Also check the cons)Wrap charging: OnePlus has given what they promised. Wrap charging of 30T support provides 0 to 100% within 40 mins. Seems like last long day.Built:There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back which makes your phone scratch proof. It has plastic frame considering low cost it's fine to have it.Speaker: There is only one speaker under OnePlus Nord. It is not ideal for videos or games, but it becomes reasonably loud and sounds good.Red club membership: It will provide you 50GB of cloud storage. Also with several benefits.Cons:Battery: 4115 mAh battery provides less backup while you are gaming. Drains quickly. But if you are not a gaming person it lasts for a day with normal use.Camera: It has quad camera setup but Micro lens of 2MP has no use. If you are a pro photographer you better know how to click micro photograph.Headphone jack: Maybe you can call it as business strategy OnePlus Nord doesn't have 3.5 mm headphone jack. So one has to buy Bluetooth earphones or ear buds. (Simultaneously launch oneplus buds and promoted)Expandable memory slot: unavailability of expandable memory slot might give you problem later after few years of use. Considering memory storage.5G: OnePlus Nord is a future ready phone with 5G setup but it allows 5G+4G sim only one 5G sim could be used at a time.In the end If you are a fan of OnePlus and love to have good performance phone with mid-range you better chose this. It's promising. 👍"
404,Sai Krishna Anantaraju,Good phone in budget but not perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I loved the display. It's big and super clear and viewing angles are phenomenol. Coming from Pixel 2, I wanted a phone that has stock android or near stock android UI as I hate bloatware or ads and I need regular updates. Thankfully, there are none. Fingerprint reader is superfast. I agree with many ppl on the pros they mentioned. A few things that I didn't like about this phone are:1. Android auto not working. After connecting phone to my car using cable, I see android auto screen on my cars gets flickering for sometime and then lost connection. You can check on this issue in oneplus community as well.2. Time will stay unchanged until you focus on the screen. Even clock app gets updated time after a fration of second. This happens when night mode on as well. When you take out your phone during the night, it will be very bright. Once you unlock, them only it will become dim.3. Edge round cutouts on screen will partially hide content on some applications.4. Google play update fails every time.5. Camera not upto the mark. Expected for a person coming from Pixel device.6. Hardware buttons are protruding on the sides and they are sensitive and can easily be clicked unintentionally. I took many screenshots without realising. I locked the screen many times as well. Buttons could've been little hard.7. As geekyranjit mentioned in one of his videos that auto brightness sensor calibration could be better. There are a lot times I manually had to increase the brightness.Overall, it's great value for money phone. It feels premium in your hand."

406,anjali.budakoti,Worst battery and camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst phone ever....please dont go for this phone this is really the worst phone ...battery drains bery fast not even last for 4-5 hours. And if you play 3-4 games of pubg it will come to 10 from 100 in just 3-4 games ....and camera is the worst..specially the front camera in low light it showing pictures you are clicking from a keypad phone.... And noramlly if you click there is soo much of noise...please avoid buying this phone
407,akhilesh y.,Network issue / Internet issue,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is huge unkown strage network issue on oneplus nord. While internet works on browser but have network issue on few apps. I could not play free fire and pubg due to network issue. But when i connected to wifi i was able to play these game.  I tried changing sims, resetting wiffi and internet setting,i even factory reset the phone but nothing works. Either oneplus should explain this strange network issue and come with a solution or everyone should get a refund or replacement."
408,Jai vikrant,Bluetooth connectivity issue.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone has a serious Bluetooth connectivity issue. Bluetooth device automatically disconnects and doesn't connects again. Since it is not equipped with a 3.5 mm jack it makes the situation worse.Oneplus community forum is stacked up with this complaint.Do it 100 times before buying it.

410,Mohammed sohel ahmed,Nord review,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is superb in quality and every aspects except camera in low light conditions I have been using this phone since one week playing pubg daily for about 5 hours there is no heating issue fingerprint reader is very accurate good battery life tested playing pubg below 15 percentage I could play 4 livik maps no tint issue observed while usage if you are heavy gamer my suggestion is no if your average user I woul higly recommend this phone I would rate 4 stars reduced one star for camera quality oxygen is superb in usage very smooth.
411,Jidnesh J.,Overall satisfied with OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Initially there were few issues with the phone, mainly Bluetooth connection stability. But a recent software update has resolved the issue. Battery life is decent for gamers, finger print scanner works as advertised, camera quality has been improved but slow motion feature no longer gives an option to choose resolution and frame rate like before."
412,Zovi,It's not upto the mark as promised,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is lil bit slow compared to my old phone vivo V7, which instantly detects n unlocks but this is not the same with one plus NordBattery life is also not upto the markNo doubt it charges quickly but it quickly  drains tooContinuous usage of 2-3hrs heats up the phone slightlyCamera quality is good specially ultra wide modeOnly 2 camera's of rear one's are working other 2 are just extra with no useSo basically they promise for 4 camera's n gives only 2Front LED screen flash is ok ok typeNot able to see in dark before clicking what exactly u r clicking..N also it's takes much time to process images, u have to remain steady for about 2-3 seconds after u captureI mean it should capture n process instantly but it takes much time to process the imageI miss notification blinker which was very helpful to meThey should have added but it's not there so unless u unlock ur phone u don't know u have received a notification or notM using this phone since 1 week n All I can say for now is evertym I m comparing it with my old phone vivo V7 i found V7 better than this.. only it has ultra wide mode which was not there with vivo"
413,kriti vyas,With updates it is getting more better.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my hands on this product on 13 August. At the beginning finger print senson was bad, camera was good and battery life optimization was bad as one morning I saw this phone just died overnight and only 1% was remaining but with updates today finger print sensor is not of much use face detection does a phenomenal job, even camera has started to improve not that anytime it was bad but just getting more better. Battery life has also improved with updates."
414,sajid abu,OnePlus nord is a great option to choose.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Here is my review about this mobile after using it for a week.Simply it's a nice mobile with all features that we expect from one plusOnly 2 negative points battery drain fast on normal uses it will run for a day.And you cannot play full screen videos on Amazon prime Netflix etc.Rest it's really nice phone. Go for it.
415,Neeraj,Quality not as expected from oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's been only 15 days and the screen showing blue spots.  Replacement date also gone.  These kind of manufacturing defects and low quality was not expected from oneplus. Quality has dropped exponentially.
416,priyabrat nayak,Please read carefully all negetive review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is very bad , serious buyer go for other brand /another one plus model just like 7T ...8.."
417,Dinesh vamsi,My 1st OnePlus phone and I like it,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's my first OnePlus phone.It is very good.. but every phone will have some good and bad things..let us discussPros:-1)it's display quality is amazing and colours are vibrant...just when you experiencing such quality you wil defenetly impressed...it's display better than samsung phones(compared with A50)2) battery somewhat good.They providing 30Watt fast charger with in the box.It's a good thing.It is full charged approx 55min.3) oxygen os...  It's super.. didn't experience any lags while  using. Finger print scanner is fast and accurate.4)camera is super.great resolution pics are coming.5)even it is monospeaker it is loud than realme samsung phones.i am surprised.sound is descent.don't worry about sound.it's output is goodCons:-1)Battery somewhat draining fast.It will come below 10 percent if you use high brightness and high refresh rate by evening.if you on battery saver mode it will come till night.2)macro lens are waste.pics are not coming with high resolution.better to use main camera for macro shots also😌.3)there is a bug.if you go to settings for enable full display for Amazon and some apps,there are showing no apps.may be it will fix via update.Overall it's good for medium gamers and best for good performance..Defenetly you can use this phone for 3 years..Another thing is that I didn't observe any tint issue.But prize somehow it's little bit high.it is better to bring base model at 128+6,8+256,12+256Anyway I am satisfied with this device"
418,Laxman,Just a budget phone,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Budget phone
419,Vinu,One plus nord marble blue 12gb variant,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  ProsValue for money. I availed the Amazon exchange program as well. Hats off to oneplus for engineering this product. The 90hz panel is the best feature of the phone. The 765g does not feel slow at all. I have the 12g ram variant. Build quality is very good even though the frame is plastic. The marble blue color is beautiful. The stock android experience is really cool.ConsA little disappointed with the camera package. Though there are 5 to 6 of them, I feel they should have cut down on the numbers and focused on improving the wide angle lens and overall image processing."
420,Gowtham,Not a good Phone.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  If your are old Oneplus user you will be disappointed. I am sharing my view based on comparing my old Oneplus 5TIf you consider Camera this is not worth the upgrade from Oneplus 5, 5T, 6, and 6T Camera. (Take a pic with trees or plants in the background and compare)Sound (Speaker) is averageBattery life is same as Oneplus 5TOnly good think is display is smooth.Processor is slow compare to Oneplus 5T. Takes time to click and process the images initially is shows pixels in-the images after sometimes it loads.Apps repose is slow (Instagram, Olx, Facebook.)Network (JIO) Is not up-to the markIf you downloading something and try to use other apps its takes time to respondEven with the full network coverage Browser goes offline.Only with the Hype by saying 5G ready and Lesser availability there are marketing this phone.5G is minimum 1.5 yrs away think before buying this phone"
421,Irfan Jamal,Good Phone Overall with bad low light photography performance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is good overall. No performance issues whatsoever (it has beefed up specs, so yeah) and the good old Oxygen OS is snappy as ever. The display is good too (colors pop). The main camera (back camera) is great. It has a lot of detail, handles dynamic range well and the photos come out good (albeit a tad bit on the brighter side). The wide angle camera is okay at best. The macro, meh. The selfie camera is fine too (but struggles heavily under low light).Overall a good phone, with a good main camera (others are just ok)"
422,khushbu,Never settle with a faulty OnePlus Nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is not worth even  Rs.15000/- .After setting up the mobile, it was found that Power button is not working & mobile is not switching off. The display is becoming dim on its own & phone is heating up like hot cake & draining the bettery quickly."
423,Sanjay Kumar Jena,Good buy for the First time Amoled and 90Hz users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good phone having pros and cons equally. Camera is good except the macro cam which is completely worst and of no use even after 1-2 updates it's still the same. So if you put a black tape on the macro camera lens it will be better 😆, at least you don't have to see it then and regret.Next thing is display, which is awesome for me as it's my first Amoled display phone. Watching Netflix, Amazon Prime on this device is an awesome experience.Battery is decent as it has to be for a 4100mAh. Charging speed is something that I'm in love with. I have to keep an eye while charging it as I don't like to keep it unattended while the battery's become fully charged. So it's super fast charging.There is no heating issue till now but can't say anything about Gaming (pubg etc) as I don't play games on mobile.Bedtime mode which greys the screen sometimes doesn't work 🧐and I have to off it and then again on it then it starts working.Now the most important thing, tint issue and black bar. I think it's completely negligible in my device especially Tint, but there's a black strip in the line of front camera but its okay and not a big issue as shown by many YouTube reviewers especially those who doesn't get the reviewer unit😆.Video is something which I can say is AWESOME. Even if there is only one subject it is capable of Bokeh video shooting. 4k 60fps is mind boggling.At last waiting for the update when Macro can be actually give performance like a macro camera which is looking like an impossible task in near future.Plastic frame is a bit disappointing but with a case(other than the transparent case as it will turn yellowish in 1-2 months) one can prevent scratches.Overall it's a good phone and the hype created is somehow justifies the product but not totally so."
424,Siba chanda,"Using 1.5 month of My first phone, above 25k!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  AFTER USING ONE MONTH :-I got the delivery of this phone in 3rd August ( before 1day of launched). For this thanks to amazon. After using 1.5 month I am happy with this phone. In early time it seems a battery draining issue, but after 5 updateds in one month, now it is in a stable position. Now It's give you 7-8.5 hrs screen on time. It's fingerprint reader and face unlock is just lighting fast. Gameplay is upto the mark. There has no place to complaints. In fantic mode graphics and gameplay experience is actually enhanced. Camera is decent, not very good. In daylight camera performance is good, but in low light, it struggle. Selfie is also give you a decent performance. In daylight slow motion work properly but In low light , slow motion is just disgusting. The lights are blinking all the way in the video, for which you can't take any slow motion video in night. I reported it to the customer care of OnePlus and send them a video sample. They said to me, they give an OTA updated for this problem, but till now it is not solved by them. Except this, I don't face any issue with my phone.CONCLUSION:-This is a phone with 5g ready(which is currently waste, bcz in india there has no 5g). So, If you are looking for a balanced phone, not specialized in any section, want to experience oxygen os, take a phone for 5-6 years....then it is for you. Otherwise there are many phones in market in this price range, which are specialized in one catagory (like camera, processor etc).Is it helpful for you, then tap the helpful button."
425,Mani kandan,Which way .?? #nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Display - 90hz as usual smooth and amazing.Camera - Main camera not bad but got a system update for improved camera quality.Battery - As usual warp charge one plus best feature 70% - 30mins.Performance - Blazingly fast performance  no performance issues and added advantage fnactic mode for gaming purposes.
426,Faisal M.,Waste of money is worth only 20 k phone,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Display is OK doesnt look like a amoled display. Samsung m31 has far better display at low price. Nord is quick. Sound system is bad sound explodes it feels. Doesn't look like 90 hz either. Feels like a cheap quality one plus phone. Samsung m31 is far far better than this.
427,Gowthamm M,Read it full,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Moved on from redmi note 4 itself a big upgrade.Game: A little bit heats up while playing pubg. Am a light Gamer, hardly spend 1 hr. Heats up. After closing the game it will become normal.Fingerprint sensor: perfectly ok,but my right thumb work perfectly..but left thumb sometimes hit or miss even though my left thumb got two fp stored.Camera: It's good only. Processing takes time. Asusual two back and two front are good. No wrds any other two in back. Front gives you raw image in selfies. Low light need improvement. Overall Okayish. Not perfectPerformance: Top notch. Happy with it.Display: I just love it.Audio: goodBattery:  This is where I am disappointed sometimes. Needs optimization. 60hz seems to consume more battery hardly 5 hrs.UI: missed small small requirements. Like haptic feedback when someone attend the call, it will be helpful for many. Can't able to see daily data usage, small improvement. All will say this OS is good bla bla bla. Yeah it's minimal, Especially I am moving on from MIUI. That's y I am missing such things I used to, which is a basic requirements only. Out of 10 I will give 7...... Because of battery and processing speed of camera and need small improvement on OS"
428,dipak dehree,Disappointed camera performance better i bought realme x3,3.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus if you are hearing me this time I felt cheated because the camera hype was so much that it will be very good camera and just because of camera and one plus branding I purchased this phone and totally disappointed I am looking forward to replace it as soon as possible till I will wait for any updates regarding camera if they can do it before 27 August iw I'll be happy to keep this phone or I will replace
429,Chris Paul,Loved the Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall satisfied...I am not facing any issues like tint issue an be the Bluetooth connectivity issue. Í have been using this device since the 5 th of August and i am happy to say that Nord is definitely the value for money smartphone you are looking for.... The negative reviews are basically simply degrading the hyped ONEPLUS Nord.... I hope you guys would like the phone..  I feel its camera is not the best at this price segment
430,Jishnusuresh,Overall best phone under 30k but if perfomance and camera is your preference go for another device .,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.PROSSuper display { fluid amoled }Fast charger / battery backupDesign, weight, thicknessOverall good performanceCONS plastic framingMacro and depth no use worst cameraNo headphone jackWhile in dark mode you can face some colour issues in Google crome.If you are a gamer or like to get the best performance just go for realme x3 or redmi k20If you are a overall medium user you can go for it."
431,Sumit ,Fabulous!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is the best phone one can buy within a budget of 30k. I was pretty much confused at first, as there were many negative reviews about the nord, but finally I decided to buy the 12gb variant.And all I can say is it's completely worth it as i wanted a phone for multimedia purpose which requires good camera, good resolution in display, smooth performance. The nord completely meets my expectation.Battery could have been a lil bit better but also don't forget that the device runs in a 90hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to 60hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too, charges from 0-100 in around 70mins, which is quite good i suppose.People saying it's a over-hyped phone, it ain't, other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market!Go for it without a second thought, you won't regret."
432,Parth Timani,Budget King👑 | Oneplus Nord is Good option to buy under budget.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera quality of Oneplus Nord is Good for Daylight and Night. Battery life is also quite good and charging speed is so fast!But i think that it’s a good option to consider on Budget with Stock Android (Bloatware Free OS) and finally it’s 5G Phone so we can use it for future (Jio 5G)For more information about camera review watch My Video on iProTechHub.
433,Vicky soni,"West of money ,",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus Note could have a much better improvement, but OnePlus did not pay much attention to it.  One is that its battery is given very little, which gets off very quickly, and the matter of display has been given to the display.  But it does not appear that it will be not displayed.  With this, the best display works in the country and the maximum problem is one of camera and the other of battery.  Once in a while the camera is never able to capture the photo.  Blocks most.  Photo and battery drains very quickly, so maybe Banda Plus had to pay very good attention to both these things.  The rest of the operating system is good.  works great.  There is no harm.  The fingerprint sensor is also good.  Its video stability is also very good."
434,Amit Dubey,Not worth,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera quality of the product is pethetic not even compete with 10000 phone in the market....don't purchase you will definitely regret about this.... Now both amozon and one plus answer ing my calls...not even able to return....
435,Divesh Singh,Best in it's Segment!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best phone in this Segment, Don't go with the negatives comment as they want everything in a 30k device, Camera is Upto Mark,  The 48 Mp. Main Camera does a pretty decent job and The main Oxygen Os for what people buy it for you'll love it. Go for it. It looks Premium."
436,Dinesh,Average Phone - Buy Power bank and camera along with this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One Plus Nord tag line is true that, they have ""stolen the 48 MP camera from One plus 8"" If they would have bought from Sony and worked on camera software, Images taken from One Plus Nord could have been better as compared to other low budget Vivo / Oppo / Realme models (While all brands - Oppo/Vivo/Realme/One Plus/IQOO belongs to BBK Electronics, China)Battery is not upto the mark and full charge goes upto 8-12 hours on moderate or low usage. My 2 year old Honor view 10 gives more battery power then One Plus Nord."
437,Karan M,Awesome User Experience With Average Camera..,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dear All,I have been using this phone since 3 days with a very heavy usage. Here are some pros and cons :Pros1) Excellent display which is super amoled2) Refresh Rate 90 hz it's simply wonderful the way phone response to your fast typing.3) Battery is pretty decent even with a heavy and continuous usage like calls, music and 2 movies it last for 16 hours easily and it gets charged easily from 0 to 100 in 60 minutes which is pretty good.4) Finger print unlock and heptic feedback is next level.5) Sleek design looks stylish and one handed use is easily possible.6 And last but not the least one plus user experience is really awesome where you get to a lot of R&D with your phone where you can customise it as per your personality.7) Video quality is also very good, you can make really good videos.Cons :Just one why one plus why can't you get your camera straight where colors are punchy and pictures are sharper. Trust me if you do this you might be in direct competition with Apple."
438,navin prakash,Camera and battery,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Reviewing after 2 week of usesPhone is running buttery smooth and I haven't face any problem.2 Things I like to mention-Battery backup can be much better.-Their is no problem with camera(hardware) but the problem is with the image processing (software).When you shoot in RAW and then post process(LR or Snapseed) it then you get best out of camera.Nothing is perfect in the world go ahead and buy it. A good value for money phone at this segment.
439,Saravanan,Nords review after 1 month use,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Before this phone, i have used Redmi Note and that UI and features are far better than Nord model. Battery life is not at all good. The battery drains faster even in idle state.  Speaker quality is not up to the mark. Don't go with this model because of the brand name alone."
440,Abhaya Meher,great value for money deal... loved to having it... awesome performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,  im using the device since 20 days and my review for the device.Great value for money product with having a good mid range processor. 90 Hz fluid amoled display gives smoother experience. camera was awesome at the price point and believed to be software update for camera for more crisp camera quality...in love with OnePlus oxygen ui..
441,Ramya naik,Satisfied 😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seeing Few negative reviews I was worried about the phone . But trust me guys it's amazing phone. You just need to know how to take pictures . Few are saying camera is not as expected but it has got good camera , smooth functioning n also new update also . So I would recommend people to buy this product . even the video quality is good. As I'm a YouTuber , I feel happy about the phone camera ,display, light and sound too."
442,Vinay Rajput,No doubt just buy it...!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  *Design is super awesome*Handy smartphone*90hz display is super smooth and colors are vibrant*Camera is great in all modes*4k 60 fps front camera is just wow*Wrap charge do its job*Very simple and clean phone thanks to OxygenOs*Battery life is also good
443,Srishti $,Over-hyped phone! Camera issues.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got the phone some days back and I have mixed opinions about this. First of all the camera is not that great. You can get phones with much better cameras at this price range. Noticed frequent lags between pictures and the camera takes its own sweet time to process/enhance photos. The front camera does beautification of photos in artificial light which is a let down. Low light performance is bad (I am seeing this blue blur in the pictures clicked at night with artificial light and have complained regarding the same.) The side panel is fragile and prone to scratches. The fingerprint scanner is decent. I am not much of a heavy phone user but yes the battery drains out fairly quickly. The only saving grace is the Oxygen OS and hence a smooth normal user experience. I had Poco F1 earlier and now this and I won't even call it an upgrade. Its an overhyped phone. Not much value for money. Plus you got to invest extra for phone accessories!Maybe updates would solve some of these issues in future.
444,Arjun T,"Green tint, black bar and thin scratch",1.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this product. I waited for 6 days. I had a Samsungnote 8 earlier but this was much better. There's green tint with black bar and I thought I'll manage but the most distressing thing was that there was a thin long scratch as I removed the preapplied protector. I've sent for request of technician hopefully he addresses the issue and replaces it
445,Adarsh A.,2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing review after 2 week of use. I was very skeptical about buying it and also after buying it, I was thinking of returning it. The main reason being that in display, white appears little yellowish in every screen settings.But after using it, I found more pros than cons:1)Display is awesome. Colours come out real goods.2)Phone feels good too in hands but not better than MI A1.3)Camera is not bad, camera app is. Google Cam give far better results in the lower resolution settings (with the same camera). Although nightscape is better in stock app.4)No problem in gaming.5) Battery charges in about 70-75 mins fully from 0 to 100.6) In normal usage, battery last for atleast a day.7) In heavy mode, battery last for 4-6 hrs.8) Battery some times get warm even in normal use.Overall: Not good for photography and not best for gaming but this phone offers 2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does."
446,surendera B.,OnePlus for 29999  waste of money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  When comparing with 7T camera quality is worst. 0Battery 1day 3times have to charge. On call connection with wifi. Battery drains 30min 2percent always keep an eye on battery.Other china make is far better With MI & Vivi.OnePlus for 29999  waste of money
447,anupam roy,The best ever phone in my life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My best mobile ever. So smooth like butter and I am feeling very happy to have one plus in my hand. Battery back up is just awesome, very first response, camera is very good, you can use both mobile data and wifi data simultaneously, you can instantly find an object by the help of Google lens inbuilt with the camera, nice feel of the handset when in hand, dedicated ringtone or vibration key at right side, dual channel network selection, dual volte, very good indisplay fingerprint sensor, you will get back cover in the box and screen protector already with the handset. If you are thinking a very good high end alrounder phone then you can purchase this OnePlus Nord, you will not regret."
448,Sumit,Better than before 🙂,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would like to say that the look and features of the phone is really nice but what I found missing is the notification light ,camera quality was not same as OnePlus other phone as m user of one plus 6 from last two year and most concern part is bettry life m not using this phone that much still the phone is sucking up battery so fast n taking time in charging also ....this is only my top concern otherwse feature is nice m not that much technical but whatever was in my last phone this is better easly can go for it no device is perfect rather u spent lack or thousands ull find any of lackness in something everywhere .....thanks amzon for best deals I got this phone at 26 k that is pretty gud ...my only concern is bettry pls let em know if someone facing same then I'll go for exchange 🥺"
449,Yodha singh,Wonderful,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Very good smartphone. Display quality excellent. Bettery backup very good.smooth OS no lags. am very happy with this and go for it .
450,Tathagat M.,I am loving the OnePlus Experience!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is worth it.Pros:1. Oxygen OS is butter smooth and the experience has been amazing.2. Screen is superb as well. Its a breeze to watch content on this screen.3. Battery life is great as well. For my usage getting almost 6.5-7.5hrs of SOT everytime.4. Fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate for 90% of the times.Cons:1. Camera could have been better. Dont get me wrong, the main camera(48MP) from OP8 is totally worth it. The other cameras are either useless or are not up to the mark. Selfie camera is also not that great if you compare to previous OP 16MP sensor.2. The mono speaker is loud enough but its not even near the amazing experience of 7T's stereo speakers. This is not a con but rather a wish that is unfulfilled.This phone has been worth the amount that I paid for it. I have received almost 5updates till now, which have improved the camera, battery etc."
451,AKHILESH TIWARI,Overall Good except Battery backup,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Fingerprint reader and Face unlock both are fast. Camera is not as per hype created before launch but it is decent. Processor is quite good. I am satisfied with everything except it's BATTERY. Nowadays almost all the smartphone brands are offering bigger batteries (>5000mah) but OnePlus has compromised with the battery in Nord. I have to charge twice in a day. As their charger (30W) is quite good so it gets charged quickly.
452,Sonu singh,Please Read review before but this phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looking good and hand feel nice, camera good, why audio jack missing in this phone? But oxygen os is superb experience you forget everything, but I am very disappointed why no Auto call recording is basics require on this time in every phone, please OnePlus improve it on immediate basis that would be great,And also battery backup not up to the mark.But dear friends you can go with this phone every thing is very good"

Heating issues after 25mts of usage and then hanging5 no proper response from Amazon customer care.6. Very very poor whatsapp video call quality."
454,Girish Rathode ,"Not phone a for 30 k , its really you are wasting 30k for a dummy phone!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Actually the cost will be around 10k r 12k. I have expected a good camera quality.2.Display issue.3.Battery Draining like hell.4. You cant use message authentication with google pay r any other app that recognizes auto OTP for a dual sim.  This the feature where it totally failed.5. Voice Assistance is not up to the commands are going wrong.6. The accessibility feature for Blind people is totally ignored, they cant use the , where the many cases are failed for that.7. All the youtube channels ( UNboxing ONeplus Nord )are sold because they didn't find out the issues and showcases the fake news abt the phone.it totally failed the product.These Chinese manufacturers proved they are good at selling dummy products."
455,Himanshu Pilkhwal,Expected the unexpected,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fingerprint reader is as fast and efficient as one would want. The camera is subtle , the AI does a pretty nice job . The macro camera I haven't used much but didn't seem to be impressive . The front and the rear cameras are up to the mark. Dont expect it to be very zoom efficient, but it gets the job done in most of the cases. You will love the camera anyway . Night mode is super luminous in this phone ,you can't tell if it's a night or evening. Display quality , build everything is good but the battery is drained pretty quickly. Like with calls , WhatsApp & browsing it hardly lasts a day. the fast charger could have been more Efficient.  Also it doesn't feel like a 12 GB RAM phone sometimes"
456,Arpit Mittal,Shifted from Redmi fan to a One plus fan.!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well Honsetly Redmi had changed the market completely with their superior configuration and smart marketing strategy into delivering a decent budget phone.Having said that after using Redmi phones from past 4-5 years, needed a change and then came this mid- budget phone with extradinory specs and  premium design.Not to mention got it in steal deal price by exchaning my previous Redmi phone and the pre-order bank offers.Pros -Display and fingerprint reader - Well this was a big surprise for me as I had not been used to such beautiful effortless display which just follows your command as you want. It makes you feel that you are holding a premium phone without a doubt. Fingerprint reader is exactly at right position and works seamlessly.Speakers - Well some people are reviewing the speaker is not upto the mark but based on my experience the speaker is very good compared to my any previous Redmi phones I was using. In fact you would be easily satisy with the sound at 75% itself.Oxygen OS 11 - I was a Google nexus fan initially which used to give straight pure Android out of the box. Well this Oxygen OS is equally good.The balance between the original Android and the Oxygen OS 11 is very UI friendly and a new user will definitely feel a sense of friendliness with the UI. It has already got two major updates.Battery life - Again a plus point for an average mobile user.It easily spends complete day with me with lot of phone calls and what's app chats with good amount of juice still remaining durign the bed time.And what a charger man. Just 15-20 minutes of charging is required and this boost up like anything.Cons -Camera quality - Yes that's right. There could have been some mprovement areas in the camera section based on the price tag but still it does its part for a medium user.Headphone jack missing - Probably it's a new trend but it still pushed me to spend some additional bucks for a wireless bluetooth headphone.Overall It's a good budget phone which one should definitely consider it in this price range and it surely justify it's tag - Pretty much everything you could ask for.!!!"
457,Siddhesh Sawant,Must Buy !! A Complete overall package from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very good again from OnePlus. They manage to keep the trust of their fans once again.Pros :1. 90hz refresh rate with AMOLED display feels awesome.2. Oxygen OS from one plus has one of the best user experience in the Android Market at present. No unnecessary blotware or Ads3. Battery life is very good. With moderate usage it will last for a whole day or slightly more. For extensive gamers, it will give around 12 hrs of battery life. You won't complain about battery because of the Warp charge 30T. It will charge your phone to 100% in 52-55 mins.4. Dual selfie camera is outstanding. Can capture details very well alongwith a wide angle option.5. Main primary camera perform very Good. Sony IMX586 sensor captures details very well. Nightspace mode allows better photography at night as wellm6. Although there is a lower chipset in Snapdragon 765G, but trust me there is hardly a few milliseconds difference on comparing it with higher Snapdragon chipsets. You won't notice the difference until you are a very hardcore gamer7. Software Updates for 2 years is another welcoming thing with this phone.8. One plus alert slider is always a plus in its devices9. Great video recording options from both the front and rear cameras. OIS and EIS help you to record 4K videos with great clarity.10. No display Or Tint issues about which many people were concerned.11. Although India might not have 5G support right now, this phone provides 5G facility making it future proof.Cons :1. Macro camera doesn't seem to useful at all. It is just added for the sake of increasing the number of cameras on the device. Overall camera details could have been better.2. Plastic frame on the sides could seem to be a negative point considering Gorilla glass protection on both the front and back sides. Using a phone cover won't make you recognise it.Opinion : Although some features might not be the best , but when you look at the phone as a whole, it definitely is a complete package.I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a mid-ranger with a premium experience."
458,Abhishrey Singh ,Great Experience over the past 13 days,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well, this is my first experience with any OnePlus phone. i bought this 12Gb-256 gb variant and i'm impressed with the phone's daily performance. Earlier, I was using the Mi A1 for past 3 years and needed a change. Since I was accustomed to Android One I felt OxygenOs was the to go option for me this time around.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Smooth and easy to work around with customization and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro’s:• 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display is good and Battery lasts the whole of the working day(around 10-17% at the EOD).• OxygenOS Nothing Tops It.• Camera’s – Well, I do love taking snaps form mobile and work around with tweaks for everyday stories. I'm impressed with the image processing, the nightscape and the front cameras utility. The Image quality is quite good with respect to other Mid Rangers.• Stable video recording is a boon on this one. Perfect• Future Conscious 5g• Battery Performance is a big plus with the involvement of warp  charge.• Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – works fine and doesn't let you down while undergoing heavy usage. Gaming is quite okay.• No Display Issue. Maybe fixed over the second batch sales.• A prettymuch everything you could ask for.• Good Performance throughout the day.Cons:• The depth sensor and macro are literally not worth the promotions and hype they built for• Heavy users might not love this one.• No Headphone JackI don’t find more cons as of now"

461,Rohit Chouhan,it's not just one plus standard...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  it's midrange device so it's unfair to expect High which I realised after using it.First of all there are lots of,lots of minor bug in overall operations.Big issue including display tinting, camera performance, useless micro camera, battery optimization,and some stock Google apps for msg and calling which literally sucks.It seems this device is still in testing phase and not very stable.UFS 2.0 literally pathetic here, u can see loading in motion.I must say...it's just not one plus standard."
462,Bishal Ghosh,A reliable option !!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros-1. Smooth interface. (Oxygen Os)2. Screen is very good.3. Picture and video from the front camera is crisp.4. Video from the main camera is very standard.5. Internet speed on this phone is faster than my Honor 8 Pro over the same wifi network.  (Don't know the reason though)6. Can play the popular games without any hiccups.Cons-1. Pictures from the main camera is not upto the standard of a 28k phone.
463,Ajay,Overall best product in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received before the expected date, on Janmashtami. What an auspicious day to receive phone, its a gift to my wife. Temper proof packaging. Surprised to know that its manufactured by Oppo & good part its made in India.Basis usage on day one.Superb screen, bright colors, awesome lag free performance for 4k videos thanks to 8gb ram and super fast 765G processor which is Said to be among the 10best mobile processors Available in the world.Not observed any heating during full charging or playing videos etc. Got download speed of 4mbps Using 4g sim. Fast charging , full charge in 50 min. Camera quality is good. 2x zoom and 10x digital zoom. Good performance with flash for both front and back cameras under dark conditions, in my case there is no light in room. Though nightscape mode is available but not good and not clear pic. So use flash instead of nightscape mode. Disappointed with camera zoom And should have been better. Overall Fantastic performance For phone.Phone came along with silicon back cover but it smell too bad. So wash silicon back cover before use. Decent battery back up considering wifi, data usage vid play. OS is latest and meets the exoections. As promised by one plus received 6months of extended warranty. Suggest to purchase with Acko warranty.Finger sensor and face unlock still to be checked.Will update further with longer use of phone."
464,Prashant Doshi,Overall great product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using Nord for almost 4 days now.General issues reported by others :- Many users have faced display issue, which I didn't face, not even slightly.- Camera quality is not that bad as shown in some reviews, though I'm not that much using camera. But still photos, from front cam and back cam are good and clear. Video recording is good.- some users have faced battery drain issue but not for me. I'm getting avg of 7 hrs SoT, with total of around avg 23 hours in single charge. In this 7hrs, I payed around 2 hrs of CODM, streamed videos for about 3hrs and rest general work. Also note that during this time, Bluetooth was connected all the time. So I'd say battery backup is good and if you don't play any games then it might last you around 9 hrs of SoT.- Fingerprint reader is fast and working good.Many are facing other issues but I haven't faced any of them including network problems. But if faced, you can go to community where they have shared some suggestions which might help you out.Also I haven't switched to 60hz, during all these usages, screen was at 90hz.Overall performance is blazing fast and device feels premium.Great experience using Oxygen OS. 90hz is feels very smooth.In a sentence you can say that it's great device."
465,rimi Ganguly,Absolutely worth it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Starting with the body and design... It's easy to handle and enables a firm grip.The fingerprint sensor could be faster but it does the job!The battery life is great. Charging is super fast and lasts a day easily despite heavy usage with multiple apps.The back camera in well lit conditions takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colours . The nightscape mode is brilliant as well. The front camera in well lit conditions or with flash takes amazing pictures.The only slight disappointment is the front camera in dark conditions without flash.All in all this is a great buy for the price and absolutely worth it :)
466,Vaibhav ,Superb phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros :1) Very good processor2) 90hz display makes scrolling very smooth3) Charging speed is good (30watt charger)4) Oxygen OS5) Build quality and looks6) Comes with pre applied screen guard and back coverAverage things :1) Camera is ok for the price range but not great2) Battery (4100mAH) is just averageCons :1) No headphone jackCons:1)
467,Chandrahas,Really bad camera,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased nord for my wife just for camera and oh boy camera quality is bad, indoors pictures are too much grainy, front camera quality is also bad.I tried to play with camera settings but still a bad camera phone.My wife's 3 years old moto Z takes much better photos.I already have oneplus 7T and it has great camera. But this time OnePlus let me down.I will try to return this.Edit: tried to request return, however bad photos is not good enough reason to return phone, a technician will check Phone and confirm if return is possible.Edit 2: So return was denied as grainy images issue is not a valid issue to return device.If camera quality is important to you, please look for other device."
468,mohit,Overall it is good for regular users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finally I got one plus nord which is best middle budget from from OnePlus. This was not expected from one plus at all coming to pros and cons of phone.Pros:* One plus has provided 30T charger which helps to charge quickly it takes 0 to 100, 45minutes.* Display is fantastic provided fluid amoled display.* Refresh rate 90hz it's very fast and good experience.* Looks like premium experience.* Battery performance is absolutely fantastic.Cons:* Camera quality is not gud at this price we can get gud phones which was especially for camera, mainly rear camera 2MP was waste instead they might have replaced with 5MP seems good.* Build quality they have designed plastic frame seems worried.* Performance wise they have installed 765 Snapdragon with 5G technology, so at this price we are getting better performance phones like realme X2 pro.* There was no 3.5 ear phone jack and Dolby atmos.* Speaker was built down side of the phone so it disturbs a lot better speaker was built above the phone.* For gaming we cannot experience good.Overall, for regular usage and especially for people who are willing once a while with latest technologyI.e., 5G can go with this phone, those who are purposely purchasing for gaming better to go for other phones at this price."
469,Rashan s.,This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days.Pros- Amoled Display is very good from viewing any angles. The colors are so rich especially the blacks are really black.- battery.... After a week of use after heavy use it lasts for a day. But the charging technology oneplus uses is mindblowing. In 20 minutes of charge you will get more than 40 % battery charged.- cameras are really great work doing front and rear. Literally the videos don't have shakiness.-fingerprint sensor is very adaptive. So smooth and fast.  Don't forget to set your fingerprint before applying any screen protector.-personally i love the alert Slider of Oneplus devices.-Future ready Device this is 5G ready phone.Cons--missing the 3.5mm audio output jack. I have apple airpods so i dont need that 3.5mm jack. But you can purchase connector from the same.-Missing Stereo Speakers.-don't forget if you purchasing this device in 64 GB storage version. This device doesn't support expandable Storage. I have purchased the 256 GB version to get rid of storage problem.- macro camera sensor of this device worst. Don't try to use that 😜😜
470,Nikhil,Not happy with the product....to many bugs,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery drains too fastAll of sudden phone turns blank with one plus logo and come back to normal only after reboot is doneThis happend with me thrice in just 4 days of useIf you have any unsaved number you cannot find the number by just dailing last 3 to 4 digitI would recommend to wait and later buy this product once these bugs are removed esle no use of buying this phone instead you can go for samsung oppo in the same range
471,Ali Aman,The original segment of One Plus:,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....2. Camera: Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average.3. Display: Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. I have vivo z1 pro & Redmi note 9 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and this is only for 18k aprox. OnePlus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product. 2 rating giving for this. Otherwise features are good."
472,subhash prasad,Butter smooth but camera and battery life not upto mark in this range of 28k,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this phone in around 26.5K after applying bank discount and all.Over all experience is good but oneplus could have enhace its camera quality specially in low light condition along with battery performance well it last almost a day in case if minimal usase and last around 10 hrs in case of heavy usase.Please find below pros and cons.Pros :1.Phone performance is very good2. Display is good and nice refresh rate.3. Indisplay figure print unlick is quick4. No heating issue in a regular uses5. Good camera in outdoor condition6. Fast charging 1hr is sufficient to get 100%7. Red cable club membership - 6 months extended warrantyCons :1. Camera is not good in low light condition2. Price is bit high in this range other company offers snapdragon 8+ series but it has S7653. Heating issue while charging that we can ignore4. No headphone jack5. Face unlock is little bit slow (minor negligible)6. Back cover style is wired doesn't make any sense.7. Attract dust to much on fron as well as back need to clean everytime.8. No external sd card slot
473,rushikesh palshikar,Better Than expected ...Best Mid Range phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Premium Phone...Better Than Expected ...One of the Best Mid Range Phone..Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud.5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) The phone looks and feels premium while using.7) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.8) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The macro lens is useless, and the camera struggling at low light..Overall It's good..2) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.3) The plastic frame but it doesn't look like plastic but it is and it makes the phone *comparatively* less durable."
474,Ravimohan Kumar,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks pretty classy even being so simple in style. Display Experia is pretty smooth, camera isn't as other one plus but it's also pretty good at this price. Gaming performance is also good. Sometimes you will see a bit heating after high use but it's ok at this price."
475,Advaith,Balanced one which is getting better.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The device is beautiful.Charging speed is a major highlight.There are some software related issues which I hope the OnePlus team will rectify asap.Camera is fine except the macro.Also I didn't find depth sensor much useful.I prefer the gcam for portraits.i get an avg battery life of 6 to 7 hrs under optimised conditions.Front cameras are gud. The speakers are also loud.Also there are some connectivity issues with OnePlus buds.Speaking overall it is a great piece of tech.I like the overall design, weight and balanced output from it.I have been getting constant updates from OnePlus, which help the device better in many small ways.I took the 256gb variant which is a gud one and I would recommend it but if depends on person to person, so I have no storage issues till now.I was able to play pubg at hd graphics which was great, like I was satisfied.Other games also run well, like pretty smooth.Heating up is there but insignificant if you don't play at a stretch.I have been having some troubles with a few apps but as I said they are rectified.I am enjoying it.👍"
476,Harsh Shah,4.7 / 5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sharing my review based upon experience of 5 days using Oneplus Nord Grey Variant (12+256)Classifying the major aspects in average, good and superb.1. Body - Good. Feeling like having premium mobile in my hand2. Battery - Superb. After my office time of 9 hours, battery was still more than 50%.3. Performance and processor - between Good and superb. Few times it took 3-4 seconds to process galary. Might be becasue I had kept 60Hz. I am not gamer, so idea on that part. Overall, very smooth.4. Camera -Oh my god..so much hype there.1. Primary camera - extremely superb. I do not use macro camera. So no comments on that. Picture quality even in 12 MP is awesome.2. Front camera - Well. Here I will say average. Little bit whitish issue. Hope it will be improved in future updates. Video quality in both cameras - SuperbWhere it could have been better ?1. 3.5 MM jack - not there2. LED light for notifications - missing3. They could have provided beast front camera to just eliminate competitors. However, it's not that bad. Pretty good selfies.Highly recommended 👍👍"
477,Joell Mathew K,"Great phone,but",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Camera is not that great as the pixel 4a, but for this price range I doubt any other phone can add up to this currently. This is a great buy or if u can wait, wait until the 4a hits Indian markets.. the OnePlus is a fast,fluid,amazing phone. I own the 12gb version, if anyone is looking to buy this phone, I would recommend getting the 8gb or 12gb version because this phone has slower ufs 2.1 storage(approx 18 sec slower than ufs 3.0),this means that loading games and application are slower and in the long run it would get even slower, so go for the bigger ram versions, also there is no sd card slot so it would be better to get the bigger storage versions.All this and my 12gb version is heaven,for this price range, at this time I could not find a better phone that looks good and performs well also. But if anyone can wait for the pixel 4a, go for it."
478,ajitabh s.,Technical errors in one plus nord,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi, I purchased one plus nord on 31st aug sale since i am facing 2 problems with it. First is while searching on google sometimes it tells you are offline despite of having adequate signals, i never faced such problem with my other mobiles at aome location.Second , mobiles becomes automatically silent wothout any change in setting, it happened many a times with me , when i mossed many calls because ot becomes silent automatically.Furthermore one plus  customer support system is very poor , i am trying to contact since i have purchased it but all the time customer service number remains busy. I have mailed also about the problem but didn't get any reply till."
479,vikrant shende,Average mid-range phone with 5g. Not at all worth the hype.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera:  Quality (both front & back) not like a flagship as hyped by OnePlus. Macro and depth are fake. Front camera problem is after clicking you have to stay still for about 2 sec to get clear image else get blur. Main cam and ultrawide are ok in daylight and struggle in the night.Display: slight red and green tinting can be observed in dark.Performance: is good for day to day normal use.Battery: is sufficient and charging speed is good.Overview: Overall ok phone if u want 5G go for it. Cameras are disappointing. Display could have been better. Price should have been 20-24k.OnePlus flagship phones are better. I find my OnePlus 5 better than this.
480,Amit Kumar Ghosh,Pity much Amazing !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. Yes. It is one the best mobile phone within this price range. In-spite of all other reviews, I wanted to try this out by myself and it's comes up amazing in every corner.2. Obviously it's having some cons but it can be overcome with your smart move. For example: every where it was told that camera performance not up-to the mark. believe me or not but it's really minor which you can modify. use google cam if not happy with stock camera app.3. Best part of this phone is having same Oxygen OS like onplus 8 & oneplus 8 pro. If you are 1st time user for this kind of android, then my recommendation is try any stock android with google phone or Oxygen OS with Oneplus. You will feel the the differences with other phones.Won't say any more.. Better you try this out then say anything.. if not like it you have 10 days return policy."
481,Shrutika J.,Sleek design with premium feel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivered on 24th AugDisplay - good, no tint or spots yet.Speaker - loudCamera - Average or above (depending on lighting conditions)Battery - Average.Wrap charger - Approx 30-45 mins for full chargeFingerprint reader - works fineWish it had 3.5mm audio port."
482,Kavita,"Average camera ,great processing",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I feel it's an average phone as per the price, the processing is good, but i feel the camera which is the major factor for this phone isn't that good it take decent picture on full light but does extreme on medium light and i feel it highlights the shadows more than its needed.The back is glass which requires extra protection and camera isn't the first priority of yours it's a good phone."
483,Amazon Customer,Worth to buy,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst packaging ever . When I saw this item I was completely shocked. I thought my item must be damaged . But the phone was completely safe and nowhere damaged. I hope Amazon should improve the packaging and made it premiumNowPhone is goodDisplay is excellentCamera is pretty goodOxygen OS is marvelousOverall performance is goodLittle bit heating issueSometime camera is taking time after taking multiple shots
484,Amazon Customer,It's the best 5G ready phone in Market with this price. Must Buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   It's an awesome phone and best in class with the price it has.First and foremost I would like to clear all of you that there is no pink tint issue or camera black breakout issue with the phone, they were just rumors.I have uploaded the video checking the same by my own with device I have purchased.No such issue, and camera quality is absolutely fine I must say.Pictures I have clicked from my front selfie camera are almost level of DSLR clicked.If anybody or any tech reviewer mislead you towards tint or black crash rumors, I will suggest that please buy and check by your own.Amazon have very easy return policy.So buy and check.If you don't buy, you will miss a great 5G smartphone in lowest of price.And again it's Oneplus.No doubt at all,I am one plus user since 2015, one plus two, 6T McLaren edition and now Nord 12/256.No one can beat them for sure, they are real flagship killers by the virtue of quality and hardware they provide."
485,Aakash,A decent buy with some shortcomings,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1. You ll be surprised but battery back up is not at all good, charging covers it but bckup is very bad.2.Macro and depth camera's are pretty useless and to my surprise selfie camera doesn't even compare with redmi note 7pro it is that bad in low light, unnecessary boost and contrast.3.There is huge gap below keyboard, could be fixed via update but oneplus isn't doing the same.4. Performance is very good, no lag no complains..UI is smooth and perfect, Dark mode needs improvisation though.Overall if you don't have any urgency don't go for this phone, all the issues could be improved with software updates but let us hope oneplus does that."
486,Amazon Customer,Good phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I exchanged op-6 for this phone. Very much satisfied with the processing power . Spectacular improvement in display quality. Sound is also very good. Weight balance is very good ,I didn't felt it is of 184 gm. I am satisfied with it.Camera needs to be improved. Too many blurry images.Battery improvement is not satisfactory.I am getting little more usage time compared to op-6."
487,Amazon Customer,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought Nord with 12GB+256GB configuration.Some of my observations are:1.Its a single SIM phone2.Do not have 3.5 audio jack (No wired earphones)3.got heated while updating apps for the first time, after that no heating4.camera quality is superb5.No screen lagging due to 90Hz amold display6.It really has premium look.7.it's the best combination in this price range.Overall rating9/10"

489,Umesh Vani,Not upto the mark. Disappointed.!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  After usage more than 10 days my reviews:1. 90 hz refresh rate is good but due to low processor phone lags sometimes.2. Camera quality is ok, but not upto the mark what i thought about OnePlus.3. Heating issue is there for continuous usage of 4-5 applications some time. And it takes few minutes to cool down.4. Battery drains faster. For continuous usage need to charge twice or thrice a day. And takes around 1.5 hrs from 20 to 100%5. For gamers is not good choice. Phone lags during heavy game. And refresh rate is not as they said. Things happened in the game reflects after 4-6 seconds.6. During video call phone speaker automatically turns off and it goes on earphone mode. (Very irritating while video calls). Becomes difficult to hear at earphone mode and than talk on video.7. Most of time my number shows out of network. Don't know why.? It was not same issue in my old phone. Sim chipset might have some bugs."
490,MANJEET SINGH CHOUHAN,Awesome,4.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus nord (8+128)I got this phone around 27000 with ICICI BANK 1000 rs Cashback offer. I want to buy 12+256 but that was not available onsite at the time so I purchased this 8 +128gb with oneplus bullet wireless earphone. The colour is quite good.fingerprint sensor is awesome is responsive and fast.I just changed from 10000 phone to 30000 rs and it's my first expensive phone.Battery life is somewhat I can say negative point in this but I have to charge 2 times per day. But with the help of 30 word it can charge so fast.Camera quality is very good in this price.Display is also very ee islii colour optimised so it's quite good to see a big display with oneplus AMO LED.Front dual camera is also good in this segment.Blue colour is quite awesome and very cool.I was just confused with the colour option but finally about the blue one and it's awesome really awesome so don't think just go for it.
491,sandeep Kumar,Better choice of smart phone alway and misbehaviour of customer care,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Best phone ever good to buy .... everything is ok but I m very disappointed with customer care executive ( Abhishek and Sayantoni) they give me bad and wrong commitment and misguide with product delivery date and time also not able to resolve the query....and also without my permission  my product is rescheduled..still disappointed from Amazon customer care service.
492,iliyas shaikh,Great choice to go with,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   The device is Amazing.. People expect alot from Oneplus n which is why they critisize if something is not according to their will however these are the same people who buy iPhone SE2 iPhone xr,x,11 for 40,000 n happy woth feature half then what Nord is providing themCamera potrait mode is meeting the expectationsMacro camera is just the beginning of reaching different league in midrange.Wide Angle is great at time a bit weird..No green light on 90Hz which everyone is claiming looks like oneplus fixed the issue..As its 12Gb Ram no lag good at multi taskingBody is good need more colors available like green, purple,intersteller,lavender..Battery drains quickly as Im a heavy user it doesn’t come to me as a surprise or shocker...Loving the overall feel of the phone.. this is a phone better then Oppo Reno latest series, iphone SE2,Xr,11"
493,Kindle Customer,Things not expected from OnePlus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good but its over priced only because of brand. Battery life is not great and lack of headphone jack hurts. Phone heats very quickly and camera quality of rear side is more than average but not great. OnePlus has not given many features in this device like it gives in other devices, kind of lighter version of Oxygen O.S is used."
494,harish b.,Battery And Heating Issues,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Hi I have order 12gb Blue marble OnePlus Nord by amazon on 6 Aug. I got this device on 8 Aug from that I faced battery issues draining very fast also for 5mins YouTube video surfing the mobile getting heat as much. I can't able to tolerate this from oneplus and also I have spent 30k for this device. I have contacted amazon technician team they told to install blancco app and they checked there is a battery problem and heating issues. And they told sir this time we can't replace your device due to no stock. They registered complaint against for replacement ones the device getting back in stock. But my available time is 20 Aug. Please resolve my issue and give a replacement device for this device.Apart from the battery the mobile is premium while using. We definitely feel the flagship experience in OnePlus Nord. I appreciate OnePlus for this smoothness. Only drawback is battery otherelse mobile is awesome.

497,Swati,Worst phone I ever had,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is a nightmare for heavy users. You need to carry the charger wherever you go. The front camera is pathetic. Reminds me of nokia 6600 I used 15 years back. The apps start on their own and it hangs a lot. Talked to customer care and followed their instructions, still behaves the same way . Amazon please take this phone back."
498,Rithwik Joseph,"A Steal For Under ₹30,000",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review is being written after 2 weeks of usage with the phone. In a nutshell, I would say that the phone has performed extremely well for me. I will list out the pros and cons here from my experience over two week.Pros:1. The Snapdragon 765G processor coupled with the 12GB of RAM helps the phone run very smooth. Other than the occasional negligible hiccups experienced on any phone, I do not have any complaint about how smooth the phone is.2. Fortunately, my device has not yet experienced any kind of screen tinting or black bar issues.3. The 90Hz refresh rate is so satisfying to use. Though inferior to 120Hz displays, it barely makes any differences in terms of watching YouTube videos or so.4. The 765G processor is indeed optimized for gaming, as I was able to get a smooth experience with Call Of Duty with Graphics and Frame Rate maximised. I did not experience any kind of lag. Other games like PES and Asphalt 9 were also running very smooth for me.5. The 30W Warp Charger is indeed pretty fast. I usually charge my phone from 30-100% and it takes somewhere around 30-40 minutes for this.6. There is hardly any bloatware on the phone and most of the pre-installed apps can easily be uninstalled at your convenience.7. The Colour Saturation on the screen is pretty well managed and you even have various options to adjust that to your preferences.Cons:1. The battery life is something that I am a little disappointed about. If you are looking for a phone which can get you through the day with occasional surfing and videos, then definitely go for it as it can stay alive for an entire day without recharging, but if you are a gamer, then I suggest you look for alternatives as games tend to drain your battery quite a lot.2. Camera wise, I would say it is good, as the 48MP main camera does capture good quality pictures with proper colour saturation and details, but when it comes to the wide angle camera, sometimes, the edges seem to blur out a little, thus reducing the detailing. The Depth enabled sensor is also pretty good, though sometimes it suffers in recognizing the foreground and background and may blend in together, though majority of pictures came out pretty good. It is better not to talk about the macro lens as they are way below average. I would suggest anyone to not use them, instead click with your main camera and crop out and you are guaranteed better quality pictures. Low Light photography is also average as most of the pictures are grainy, but the nightscape option makes the pictures look fantastic even in low light. The selfie camera was also good as it captured some quality pictures.3. While gaming I did experience a negligible amount of heating, though it could have been due to other factors.4. The plastic frame of the phone is a drawback, though a quality bumper case would solve that problem once and for all.Barring these few drawbacks, I would recommend the phone to everyone mainly because OnePlus is very punctual in rolling out system and security updates. Also there are many inbuilt features such as the one that automatically suppresses notifications while gaming."
499,Aviral dobhal,Its just a normal phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So i was really excited for my first one plus phone but only thing special about it is oxygen os everything else is just ordinary.CamerasMain camra and ultra wide cameras are really good. Although I am not able to see difference between 12 mp and 48 mp photosPortrait mode photos are below average. Very poor edge detection. My old phone with single camera detecte edge better that this one. 90% times i didn't get a good photo with nord. 1 photo attachedMacro camra is just there its of no use. Personally i think i will never use it but even if anyone want to use it its of no use it captures blurry photos all the time.Selfie cameras are very good they don't beautiful you and capture great photos. Both look really good in good lighting conditions but in low light ulrra wide capture little darker imagesTime lapse is good slow mo is average and night mode also goodOsOxygen os is excellent with some unique and cool features like changing accent color. Only one problem i feel is that it uses lock screen password for app lock which iam not a big fan of.Blotware pre-installed. The one you can uninstall are Facebook, Insta, amazon and some one plus apps. That you can not uninstall are Netflix, YouTube music.BatteryBattery on nord disappoints me the most. I use 90hz refresh rate. Its get me total stand by time of 12 to 13 h With screen on time of about 6h. That mean if i charge phone in the morning i have to charge it by end of the day again and i don't even play games (screen shot attached).Charging is great it charges 0 to 100 in about an hour if not using it. And around 1h 15 min if i use it during charge.DisplayIt look beautiful. And with 90hz its its really fast on scrolling through insta. And i don't have any tint issue with it. I am glad i didn't choose another lcd panel phoneOther thingNo notification led is really a pain. Hope one plus provide always on display soonNo headphone jackFingerprint and face unlock is fast and reliable didn't face any single issue with them till now.Speakers are loud and clear. Not to loud but i can say it's above average.Haptic  is cool.Design feels good and premium. And the form factor is just perfect.Google phone really suck. I cant record call without informing other person in the call. It give a loud warning when starting call record that other person can also hear.Phone runs smooth no issues with the performanceso the only disappointed for me is battery life and portate mode shots. I hope it get fixed with ota as promised by one plus on forum"
500,Ashwith Aithal,Best all rounder!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered on 6th and delivered on 13th as promised by Amazon (Thanks to all the hype and demand). No complaints there!!.Have been a OnePlus customer myself in the past and having used other OnePlus phones, the nord does the same and gives that premium OnePlus experience for sure.Keeping specs aside, let's talk about the pros and cons from the daily use point of view.The Pro's:- Great in-hand feel. Feels premium.- Quick, responsive and lag free user experience,  thanks to great mid range processor and we'll  optimised OxygenOS.- Decent and Loud enough sound quality from  bottom firing speaker as well as headphones.- Best in class haptics for that premium exp.- Great AMOLED display with excellent colors. (There is no visible green tint. It's is just an  overrated issue. If you at all there is a green tint in the device , it is only ever so slightly visible at very low brightness in a pitch black room with a grey background only. So no need to worry there)- Good main camera and ultrawide camera. Also  the front cameras are excellent.- Good call quality.- Great sensors.-Great battery life. Got an average screen on time  of 6-7 hrs on decent usage (calls, video streaming,  music listening, social media consumption). I personally don't play games so the battery life is not a issue at all. Even if you are a gamer, you should get 5 hrs of screen on time.- Superfast charging. It literally charges full in less  than one hour.The Con's:- Useless 5mp depth and 2mp macro camera. It is  just of no use.- There is no headphone jack, which may bother  some people.Verdict:If you are looking for a phone that looks and feels premium, is quick and responsive, has gud battery life and charging times, can take good photos and has great software support, then this the phone for you.A Best All rounder !!!"
501,chetan,Works for me,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  So I have been using this phone constantly for the past 3 days and here is my honest opinion:1. Camera could have been much better for this price. There are ton of phones out there in lesser price with better camera. But as this feature isn't my priority I won't be returning.2. I had been using Moto g4+ for the past 4 years and my usage is not that heavy so my priority was to get a good software (as close to the Google's version as possible). So far, I'm really liking oxygen OS and as promised it isn't bloated. The phone is smooth and since I bought the 8 gb ram -128 gb variant, I won't be needing a sd card so I can use 2 sim cards.3. Battery life is actually lesser than what brands like Realme or even Moto gives in this range but because of 30 watt warp charger, it isn't a huge issue for now. Will recommend getting a powerbank if your usage is heavy and have no nearby power outlet for most of the day.4. There is no tint issue in my phone and I'm not a gamer but I have noticed that the phone does slightly heat up after reboot from software update and once even heated up in Ludo. So if you're a gamer, I don't recommend this.5. The face unlock and fingerprint reader isn't very smooth. My previous phone had a fingerprint reader separate from the screen which felt more convenient. Also you would need to get bluetooth earphones as there isn't an audio jack so make sure you have the budget for both.Apart for this I'm really enjoying this phone. I don't have any experience with newer model phones but compared to my 4 year old moto phone, this feels definitely like an upgrade software and hardware wise and hopefully this phone will last long too."
502,Alaric lewis,A phone that just keeps getting better with time!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A well balanced device..I am more of a performance guy , so at first, when I saw all the hype, specially about the cameras, I wasn't sure if I should buy this for just for the camera. So I did some research (a lot of actually)... Waited for a week after sale, so that I can get all the hands on reviews, the good ,the bad ,etc.One thing that I found was :-The specs were Good, not the best but Good enough.The camera had scope for improvement.The OS was the best part..A Great Screen...the tinting issue is very minor dosent affect anything for me personally. (not a OnePlus fan but still the issue isn't even noticeable)The biggest thing that made me buy this were the software updates ...I have been using the device since ....like the first update.... And it's just been getting better and better... An example of this would be...When I used the device after the 1st update I could go through 24hrs with 20-25% battery remaining at the end of the 24hrs...(screen brightness at avg 45%..screen at 90hz....normal useage....some gaming...some insta /msging...some entertainment...etc. )Now that's improved significantly..I get like 35-40hrs to get my device down to 20%...The updates have been addressing the camera issues too...but since I am not much of a camera guy..I can't provide much feedback on it...but for me personally....the camera seems good ..All in all... This device is only getting better!Good work OnePlus..... (PS - I hate the facebook app Installer bundled with your devices..).."
503,Souparna Supriya Banerjee,Seems like Nord hasn't been extensively Tested!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything is great except the speaker.The recipient of the call is hearing all kinds of noises and disturbances.And as discussed with amazon technical support representative, this problem is occurring for about all users.Hoping for a quick fix or a replacement of the product."
504,Muzammil,Oneplus Nord folks,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using this mobile for 15 days ,I can strongly recommend people you can buy this mobile without any doubt.Camera -- looks good which is fine at this prcie range don't compare to High end mobile but believe this mobile will not disappoint you.Fingerprint -- sometimes you feel it's not that fast reader. But am satisfied with this.Battery -- I felt it's okay 4115 mah for the normal users but for gaming lovers you need minimum 5000 mah battery.Why you should buy one plus nord at this range--Pros :1. Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor.2. 90hz refresh rate which is really awesome.3. Warp charger - no heat issues.4. Camera is good not best.5. It comes with pre installed Oxygen OS.6. Design and build quality of this mobile is great but I would recommend all to please put back cover which can help you to keep the mobile in safeside.7. Price is good for 12gb ram and 256gb rom variant.Cons :1. while you play pubg little amount of heat I can feel hope this may improve in coming updates.2. Camera quality have to improve in next updates.3. No wireless earphones provided by the company which is really bad for 30k mobile they must have some plan for the customers because again we need to pay at least 2k for the wireless earphones.Conclusion--- this mobile gives you best experience and am happy to recommend all you please try this out at 30k this is best."
505,suraj,Nothing exciting in this phone. Fake hype.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery life is pathetic. Even in very light usage it drains in one day. Display is not at all good. You can compare good dslr photos in monitor(real view) and then compare on nord n also in other phones. It's pathetic. Skin tones are very off. Shadows are too dark. Even the display is not at all bright. Seems like using a cheap phone. Fingerprint is bit slow many times. Battery, display & camera is not good. Rest performance is good. Nothing great in this phone but a decent. Hype is just a waste."
506,shubham bijekar,The killer Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Great phone from OnePlus.1. Camera is great in outdoor conditions. Indoor seems to be dull.2. Smoothness of touch is great.3. Display is just awesome4. Charging is very fast. 10-100% charges is 55 mins5. Speaker sound is not that great6. Selfie camera is best. OIS and EIS are greatOverall great performance no lag played pubg and asphalt.
507,tushar maji,Could be better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using the phone since last 7 days, Doesn't feel any problem with build(though frame is plastic).The only things bother me1. Display tint(not visible in total black image, but visible in chrome darkmode)2. Low light picture quality3. Unnecessary macro & depth camera.4. Though the launch is AR launch device doesn't support Google AR core(WTF OnePlus)."
508,Soorya Raghuraj,Neither a Flagship nor a Killer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Unlike what OnePlus had profoundly mentioned in their Amazon portfolio, the camera is ANYTHING BUT FLAGSHIP! 2MP macro is a ""2020 Joke of the Year"". Primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth. Under low light conditions, it just gives up. About selfie cam, don't even get me started. Overall, all SIX cameras suck.Processor is fast, but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet. So, gamers.... DON'T invest here.Battery lasts a day on medium usage. If you are a heavy user, DON'T buy this phone. 90Hz refresh rate drains battery even faster. Wanderlusters, please keep the charger and an ELECTRIC SOCKET handy. Recharging is quick. Very quick.Fingerprint reader is fast, if not superfast like those physical ones. So unless you are stupid, refrain from comparison.Oxygen OS in one word: AWESOME. This was one of the major reasons why I purchased this phone. Bloatware free UI is something I had craved for. I hated those unsolicited ads on Xiaomis and Oppos and Honors et. al. Also, a near-flagship from Samsung or Apple was out of question as I like my kidneys more.Long-story-short: Touch, look and feel is premium. Great UI. However, if you are into photography, gaming, wired-music-maniac (I own a TWS, so don't really care), or really tight on budget, DON'T get this phone. Rest choice is yours."
509,Ajay Sharma,I request pepole to not buy this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First of all I would like to say that this time seriously I did the mistake to bought this phone, honestly I am telling that before got this phone I was extremely excited because in my life this the is first expensive phone for me and that too one plus but when I got this literally I can not explain that what was I m feeling because my friend have one plus phone and I have used the phone of my friends so when I first time took into my hand I feel like what is that why I bought this why I waisted my money on this but now could not be done anything, you never feel like it's one plus phone screen is too small and I am not a heavy user and I only use the phone call sometime browsing but for that also it's not giving me expected battery backup as I am using one other phone where in the battery is only 3400 mah and that one is giving me battery backup better then this and the most important thing which was seriously not expected from one plus that is camera and its seriously bad bad bad even 13 mp camera phone is better then this guy's seriously I am telling you please do not go with this it's waisted of money now I wish to return this phone but nobody is listing my word and I can't return it so now it's pain to use this phone and seriously you never feel that you are using one plus mobile its feeling like normal phone only and I will never buy any one plus mobile now in my life."
510,Asish K.,Overall a great package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall its a nice oneplus package at this price, more of it, it has 5g.My review on Nord:1. Camera's colour processing is not upto the mark. You will notice this most while capturing indoors, as pics look bit faded. Camera processing takes a bit time for front camera so u have to hold the camera for a second after hitting shutter otherwise it will be shaky.2. Device is provided with Oxygen OS, the best android skin. Oxygen OS really feels smooth as butter and has a lot of handy features, the best part of it is the oneplus listens their community concerns and provide updates accordingly. But the thing I don't like is the device uses phone, message app provided by Google. So nord users will miss many features that oneplus phone and message app provides.3. Macro lens is useless, a telephoto lens should be provided instead. For macro shot u can try pro mode with manual focus and zoom.4. Battery is not that great but its the fact u will like that it gets fully charged within an hour.5. The display looks great. The most hyped display will be there in every amoled display with high refresh rate but no need to worry u will never notice that in ur day to day usage.6. Phone gets heat up a bit while charging but its not much. Its normal as ur phone gets charged so fast and its getting charged with 30watts."
511,Pranjal Sharma,Overall Package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yeah finally reviewing after almost 1 month and i can say this is a good phone under 30k where you can get pretty well software(Oxygen OS), decent battery, Nice smooth display, good fingerpint and last but not the least OK camera. It's camera performance is not the best and it's overall good with 4k60 fps Selfie video which is ultimate and also picture quality is good enough in day light and average in dim light.So what i can say is if you want to get rid of Redmi realme and can't but upper segment of OnePlus, this is a good decent phone. You can compare your needs with Oneplus or Samsung phones since those are also comes with good specs. But personally i don't like Samsung phones , so i have gone with Oneplus Nord.So yeah that's it.Thanks!!"

513,Sanjay,Decent midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The photos u saw are from gcam.Let me divide this review I will try to cover as many aspects as I can.Display: Pro:Display is superb and really good.altough I didn't notice any difference between 90 and 60hz.Con:The display has a green tint issue and every oneplus Nord has. But it did not affect our daily usage.Design:Pron:glass back feels premium but I wish it had a mattle back.Con:it has a plastic frame so not very durableOs : should I right about it it's just a waste of time it's the bestProformance: good actual it's great with oxygen osGood gaming no lags noframe drops good.Con: it does not have 8 series chipset but I do not feel the difference.Features: mono speaker but sounded greatVibration is decent although I wish it could be better5g nothing to talk about itPrice : I think it's pretty good special for 12gb variat.Camera: camera sucks front and back both camera sucks it's just take shitty pictures.Oneplus plz give upates plz.Nord vs garbage phone likes k20 pro, realme x3 series.Nord is way way better than this phone.Nord vs x2 proU might be think that the x2 pro better on specs yes it is indeed and I think it is a better phone for gamers but for all other people(include me) who game a little or do not game Nord is better .Nord vs 7tSpecs are better on the 7t but it is worth rs.10kThink yourselfNord vs 8I was really confused between the two and for rs.17k here what the 8 addsBetter performanceBetter speakersCurved displayGood vibration motorBetter ultrawide cameraAlse everything is same .Nord vs a71Though choice but NordIt's simple really that simple it all comes down to really experience in which we have a new midrange king and it's the Nord"
514,Anubhav Majumdar,"Awesome model with excellent display, superfast charging and the best OS",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using Nord for one month now and my overall experience is awesome. I would specially like to mention the fast charging option OnePlus provides us with its Warp Charging technology which is really superfast compared to other mid-range sets. Battery life is decent. Some other significant things are its superb display which comes with 90 Hz refresh rate and obviously the cool and compact design with two uncommon colour options which gives a feeling of having a flagship model. The best thing about OnePlus is its supercool Oxygen OS which is undoubtedly the best in the industry right now. You'll also get various online storage benefits, subscriptions and discounts with your Red Cable Club membership in any OnePlus set. Gaming performance is okay, but needs to be more optimized. Processor is fast enough for multi-tasking and professional editing purposes and it comes with built-in 5G technology. The camera quality and image processing are good enough for casual photographers, although it's not recommended for professional photography. Nightscape mode is outstanding. The mono speakers are okay. Overall I would give 90+ out of 100 to this exciting OnePlus Nord model. I have also shared a couple of photos which I clicked using nightscape mode. Check those out. All the best."
515,vasim,"Read Fully, Disappointment",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First, many suggested me not to buy this product after the release week, but I went for it due to the trust in company and ordered.Now, I recieved my mobile few days ago and found out huge problems... Below is the list.1. Snapchat :- The app layout in Nord(12/256) is so basic that it portrays the layout of a low end 5000/- mobiles.. the Bitmoji clarity is soo bad, pictures taken are always blurry, and you wont be abled to attend live filters, you should take picrures and then apply them.2.Whatsapp :-  Now a days video calling is the most common form of telecommunication, but the clarity of video call in Nord is very worse than ever.The video is dark and you could see the black outline all over the image processing at the back camera.In case of front, there is an smoke effect in front camera which reduces the clarity completely.3. Oneplus features :- Many old features of Oneplus had been removed here like (shelf, dock, etc)4. Camera Quality :-  The camera clarity is average, but there is a huge amount of grain in camera where it completely destroys the image quality.Front camera is worse..Others are common problems faced by all mid rangers.. like battery, Gaming, RAM handling etc"
516,sirisha,Very disappointing product..North worth buying,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yesterday i have recieved mine...i have few issues with this mobile.....1.As soon as we click a picture from front camera we need to wait for some time with out moving phone to not have a blurry image...even a very lowest price phone doesn't have this backdrop they capture a non blur image as soon as we click and move phone.2.The battery back up is not as expected as i have been using one plus 6t, we checked both one plus 6t as well as nord at same usage from 100% charge and nord drained so fast where one plus 6t didn't.....3. The back swipe is lame its not working as expected everytime we need to swipe twice /thrice to go back....better if we change it to swipe up from either of the ends as all other one plus have.....4.when ever we click pictures infront of the mirrors the pictures are coming very bad with 0% naturality....not expected this from one plus.....very disappointed i have suggested my sis as well as my friend to buy one plus nord  as i was using one plus from very long time and i trust one plus....after receiving nord i seriously dont suggest nord to  anyone.....very disappointing actually..... if possible please resolve all of them with an update....on the second day of usage i have an issue with the main apps where it shows a blank page and not displaying any apps......"
517,Indrajith,Good one💙,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after 10 daysFirst of all im just loving the Oxygen Os ❤️Display :- display is just too good for me.. but there is a pint tint towards the bottom of the screen, with latest 10.5.7 update that issue is 80% solved but with the expense of some brightness shifting. Its actually fine than having that tint issue isn't?😁Performance:- Its just smooth... I doesnt faced any lags,stucks or any app crush its just flowless. But i can see some framedrops when i scroll through some pages. I played PES on this mobile iand it was just a breeze loved playing in the device.Camera:- im not a camera sedric person for me its more than enough good details and nyc colors. But front camera should have been betterBattery:- bettery is ok i would say it gives me 6 hrs SOT with 20 hrs of charge.But it drains very quickly in the overnight 7-8.Initially it takes more than 1 hr 10 min charge but the latest updated cragged up the speed now 0-100% in 55 that is lit😼Overall:- its a good premium midranger that you can look up to...i purchased this instead of RMX2 pro just because i wanted use the device for atleast 3 years. Since that is already an year old phone and  i choose OnePlus and the infamous Oxygen OS ❤️"
518,tarun j,disappointment !!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  there was a tint on screen along camera module which is visible in low brightness, technician admitted that it was a manufacturing defect but amazon refused to give me a replacement, oneplus customer care suggested me to visit service center for a newly purchased device that is worth 30k. if these things happen in budget phones, it's okay but it's a premium midrange smartphone and that too from a reputed brand. checked oneplus forums and saw lots of users are facing same issue, in my suggestion. don't buy this product because amazon is not going to help you with this product after sale. even oneplus is not going to help you with this, the statement i recieved was that is a characterstic of OLED display, while me being using amoled screens from last 4 years, knows that it's not a characterstic feature but a manufacturing defect. not the brand which stands for quality anymore."
519,Sindhuja,Good product,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord is a good choice when it comes in to this range of 27999.. one thing I felt is ""please put a full charge and then start using"". I've seen some difference in screen. Initially I didn't liked the screen and I thought of changing it. But it's good in processing."
520,Soumik Halder,Overall the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All total the prpduct is very good with 90hz refreshment rate that makes it more faster and make sure the combination be 8g/128gb or better.. In a glimpse the camera is too good and selfie camera is also very likewise... The superamoled display makes it more attractive and good looking... A premium phone with premium features comes with the brand one plus and as a result the phone comes a good handy in this range of price... I recommemd every self worker or students to make a look at this model
521,PARTHIV MANEPALLI,A Decent Purchase if you are buying a Oneplus for the First time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am using this product for about 10 days now.Pros1) It(Marble Blue) has a very pleasing look and that is one of the major reasons which attracts people to buy this device.2) The User Interface is pretty good. Its really helpful as my previous phone had tons and tons of Bloatware.3) The Fluid Amoled display with 90Hz refresh rate is also quite nice.4) Battery Life : It almost lasts me for about 1.5 days (note: I don't do gaming, but spend more time in netflix, youtube and social media)5) Warp 30T is insanely fast. Charges my phone from 5-100% in about 51 minutes.Cons1) The Camera shoots good quality videos but only in daylight. It screws up in low light or in dark. It blurs the hell out of the surroundings making it undesirable. Same story with photos too. Some great quality during the daytime.2) Still trying to figure out the role of 2MP Macro sensor. I mean there is no reason for its existence. But even when its there, it is not working at all.3) Well, absence of 3.5 mm was anticipated but they could have given a connector in the box. That might have been beneficial for many.for better camera performance, use Gcam to click pictures. And use Stock Cam for videos."
522,Mythlesh,Better than you think,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's nearly been a month with Nord and on my opinion there's been no issues both the fingerprint and face unlock are fast the phone is so smooth even at 60Hz refresh rate and has a really good battery life. Excellent and smooth gaming performances till now screen recording is great and coming to the oxygen os its super user friendly you'll never need an external application or software to feel satisfied cause Oxygen os is one of the best in the market , camera performance is awesome the primary sensor gives much detailed and saturated images then wide angle lens both in front and back camera is the incredible the major blow would be it's macro sensor in my opinion cause the colours are much softer so if you just want to take best pictures you better buy a basic dslr but in overall performance the camera is pretty great, the phone is so slippery without a case so better use it and fast charging really saves you a lot of time, the alert slider is so usefull in short if you are looking for a smartphone in a mid range budget with cool user experience Nord is the best in my opinion but if you expect a high performance machine and ready to make some sacrifices like oxygen os,alert slider etc you have a lot of other options so choose wisely 🤞💕"
523,Kaustav DGupta,"A ""One Week User"" Experience, An Amateur User Experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Without Wasting my words and Your time on Unnecessary Explanation, Let me get to the Points Straight.*765G, A 5G MidRanger Processor is a Decent Processor when it Comes to the Daily doing stuff. It's Reliable & Fast .But, Honestly It's UNNECESSARY, Specially As Per India Market And You Know Why.*Display Produces Punchy colours and Good viewing experience.*Look and In hand feel is really Good.*And Now Finally,for the People who haven't already Experienced OXYGEN OS, to them ""THE BEST THING OnePlus CAN OFFER is the UI of OnePlus"", It's Just Wonderful.And now The Most DEVASTATING Thing about The Most Hyped Phone of 2020 ""The OnePlus Nord"" is It's CAMERA. I mean We Are Paying 28000/30000 INR for a Phone that Has A Pathetic Camera module. It's It's Pathetic. Honestly My Old Xiaomi Note 7S camera Produces more Good Looking Photos. Forget about Specifications, What we are Getting is More Important, I Think.*And They're Some Issues regarding Mobile Data networking and THE HAPTIC VIBRATOR FEEDBACK. Like Some Other OnePlus Devices It Started pinning some Vibrator Issue.Finally, It's NOWHERE NEAR FLAGSHIP KILLER. Just a Decent Phone Which Costs More For It's 5G &""FUTURE READY"" TagLine."
524,Amazon Customer,"""fancy shop, tasteless Chines food"".",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  You will buy this phone only for 1+ brand name and not for performance. I have made a mistake and chosen wrong product. It does,t  meet my expectaion. it's tag line is Never Settle but in this phone they have compromises a lot.It is like ""fancy shop, tasteless Chines food""."
525,Naga Venkatesh,AN USUAL DAILY COMPANION PHONE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a month of using this mobile, it is a clean,neat,fast & smart device which has an excellent display & OS. The main camera is as good as OnePlus 8 , but the other camera's are not at all worth. Battery life is average for an general daily usage. Small network,Bluetooth & display issues. Onething I am satisfied with OnePlus is getting updates constantly that feels me a premium feel. The community of OnePlus & the clean OS of it differ itself from other phones.Final verdict: If you believe in hype then it will not meet your expectations . If you think I need a good daily premium mobile with a good software updates in regular intervals this is the one.PLEASE DON'T BUY WITH HYPE , SEE THE SPECS WHETHER YOUR USAGE MEETS IT."
526,Adithya,Great phone at a decent price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is really good. The blue color is really striking and awesome. Purchased the 12 Gig version and it is buttery smooth, even with a ton of apps running. Display is top notch and the 90 Hertz is super slick. The macro camera is not so useful, but the remaining cameras are super. Battery life is also good and the warp charging pumps it up in no time. Overall, a very good value for money. Would recommend 10/10."
527,Mahin Malhotra,Great option for Casual users,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got my device on 4th of Aug after placing a pre order on 28th July/I don't play any heavy end games on my mobile so gaming was never a problem/necessity for me.The display is nice, earlier I wasn't used to the AMOLED display but now I am satisfied with it.The Battery is generally very good and will last easily a day for normal usage.The camera? well I was never a photo enthusiast so I don't can't figure out the biggest down point of the device.I compared it with my brother's Samsung A50 and observed the Nord has a bit more accurate colors atleast for me.The only issue I found was the tint issue but that too is observed under very rare circumstances and probably will be fixed in a future OTA.TL;DR :- If camera and gaming aren't your priority and you need a good phone with a very clean OS then go for it."
528,Sumit Nandy,Go for it : Post reading the review :P,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good phone at this price point. I have been using for last 10 days.Pros:Good camera - provided some samples hereCrystal clear AMOLED display. There is no Green Tint issue, at least with my phone.765g processor enables the gaming and overall phone experience to be seamless. There is no lag while gaming.ConsBattery optimization could have been better. I have been using op5 which has 3800mah and it provides better battery optimization. Battery on Nord lasts approx a day on normal usage and burns in 13-14 hours with heavy gaming and videos.Missing audio jack, though the phone provides hd sound output on Bluetooth headphones.Overall pretty good phone provides top of the line performance at decent price range. One plus oxygen ui makes the experience hassle free and amazing. Should definitely go for it."
529,Aswin Hari,Best phone for normal use under 30k,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is best for users who want a phone for normal usage and maximum lasting.Pros are 5G capable which makes future proof, good gaming experience, oxygen os UI, 30 watt charger, best in display fingerprint scanner as there is no lag, amoled display with 90hz refresh rate, alert slider and bloatware free.Cons are below average camera experience, average battery life, plastic frame, average speaker quality as it not stereo speakers, and dual front camera which makes problem while watching films and games.Final verdict : If you want a future proof phone and is a normal user, it is the best phone under 30k. If you are interested in photography or gaming, please buy phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 series chipset (for gamers) and take iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Note or S series or Google Pixel series (for photography)."
530,Deepak Kumar,Best Camera phone at best price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earlier it was pathetic in term of Night shots,Macro and battery backup.But due to regular updates of Oxygen interface all things are improved,Nightscape shots are even better without grains ,Best part I love is Portrait mode ..it gives more details and colors into image like 85mm dslr lens, Although iam not selfie addict but dual selvie camera is good for Vedio call or online classes even in low light gud Vedio quality in online sessions . But failed at Macro point, even iam not able to use external macro lens because back cameras are near to each other ,will try on selfie camera.later if it works.Wrap charging is awesome almost in less than 30.min full charged..Rest internal features are also unique , Now i have no regret"
531,Vanish,Moderate specs with moderate price .,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   I am having a great experience in using oneplus nord as my primary device. I have attached few of the camera samples you can check them out to get the accurate idea about the quality it delivers. Talking about battery life, i agree that its not that good but after the update power consumption is improved to a great extent and the result is visible as well ( u can have a look on the ss attached ..)Battery life - 9 hours of screen on time  with moderate usage ( including asphalt 9 ,youtube Instagram , and normal day to day surfing )Coming to build quality yes it does have plastic frame but i can assure you of the premium feel while holding it but still you have to put it in the cover almost all the time to ensure safety.Conclusion - Each and everything is moderate about nord including the price."
532,Nitika Nair,A good daily phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered the phone on 20th and received the same on 24th, the product was perfectly sealed, Used the phone or 24 hours now and the review for the phone is as followspros:1. Good battery life: Charged the phone yesterday night and until 11 am today the phone is still at 60%, overall happy with the battery life2. Full-screen display: the 6.4"" display gives you amazing viewing experience.3.Rear camera: The rare camera does an absolutely fantastic job both in daylight and at night. I was actually mesmerized by the nightscape mode, though it feels that the photo was captured in daylight it does an amazing job.4. fingerprint sensor and face lock is quite apt and fast5. Tint issue: I didn't find any tint issue on my phoneCons:The only drawback for me is the front camera but I guess oneplus will resolve the problem. The problem is after zooming, the pictures appear to be grainy, if you are viewing it on a normal mode you won't see the issue, it is only seen if you zoom in.That's the only problem I haveOverall the phone is worth every penny and I'm happy to have it"
533,Vishnu,A SMART PICK FOR A MIDDLE CLASS ONE PLUS FAN,4.0 out of 5 stars,  first of all I would like to give spoiler alert:It's not a perfect midrange phonecons:not a beastnot so fast(but suits for daily usage)battery stand by is above meanpros:execellnt UIgood ram managementvibrant displayhandy and compactExperience:basically I bought this device on a sole purpose to experience one plus feel.clean and stock ui grabbed my attention (as its the most legible os skin in android) .I had an issue with unlocking . finger print is decent but face unlock fails to work some times (not every one experiences it.. cause mine is a low lit area)as nord supports 5G it's a future proof phone but not truly(cause we are uncertain of 5G arrival-buying this for mere 5G is like waiting for a ship at an airport)I like the while packing case cause its a premium fell to open😂NORD can compete with other competitors like realmex3 pro/Samsung M51PS:IF U ARE NEW TO THE WORLD OF ONEPLUS (as they say so) This will start your journey with them smoothlyplot twist: THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW
534,Amazon Customer,Check charging/usb port of Nord.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I normally don't give -ve reviews but had bad experience with Nord. On delivered day I applied for return/replace the product bcz it was not charging at all and micro usb port got disabled on its own. This could be issue with software or hardware but didn't expect from one plus. Thankfully Amazon troubleshooting app detected it and I could returned the product. Please try charging phone first before login into Google.I have not experienced this kind of issue with phones I have used like motorolla,samsung,redme,lenovo.Hope others wouldn't be getting such issues and if you experienced something like it after replacement policy is over then I think phone needs to be given in one plus service centre and it would be headache for us."
535,Koushik P,A classic midranger,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using Nord since 5 days. Seems to be pretty much good.Pros :Display - Amoled display with refresh rate of 90Hz makes the display very smooth.OS - The oxygen OS is by far the best user friendly OS.Battery Life - Battery life is pretty descent. With refresh rate set to 60 Hz and normal use, (Social media apps and camera) the battery lasts for 8 - 9 hours (Screen usage time).Warp Charge - Charges from 0-100 in 52 minutes and 15-100 in 46-48 minutes.Processor - Phone doesn't lag a bit (No heavy gaming) Snapdragon 765g is powerful.Camera - Videography seems to be good.Cons :Camera - Out of the 4 camera(rear) only the main camera and Wide angle camera are good. Macro and the other camera are below average. Images are blurry with macro mode. If you're enough patient, click photos with pro mode.Design - The plastic body of the Nord makes this less safe and less durable.Finger print reader - In display finger print reader works on optical sensor which not fast.Pretty much more than the budget mid rangers also a little less than the flagships."
536,Illayaraja,All rounder in mid range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  All rounderAll Good expect Macro and depth sensor, however main 48 camera sensor and front 32 sensor both are great and wide angle is okiesh.OnePlus Default dialer and messaging apps are missing which is disappointing."
537,Amazon Customer,Automatic call recording is missing,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazing mobile but very disappointing thing is automatic call recording is missing
538,vikas b,"No really, settle for the Nord!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A lot of thought has gone into every single component of the phone and it's evident while using it. The phone is buttery smooth and feels rather premium. This goes to show that that specs don't matter as much if you focus on delivering a killer user experience. That being said, my device has a touch of green tint when the background is grey but it's nothing major and it's only there of you are looking for it."
539,Maddy,Batter drains quickly,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is much hype about the product but not upto the mark.1. Battery drains very quickly2. feels heavy than my previous mobile (Oppo real me, sorry for comparing but its true)3. Hanging frequently4. dial pad is very short even though the screen is 6+ inches5. Setting up and naming alarm is not available6. Thumb unlock is not as good as its mentioned7. The charger adopter looking like a stabilizer (heavy and big)8. There are other defects too, i will keep addingBut one plus should pay me for the defects i observed and making the product next version better. ;)"
540,Shivanand,Good phone. Selfie cam could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazon delivered the product before the promised date. Packaging was good and exchange of my old phone took place without any hassle. Coming to NORD, it came with preinstalled apps such a as amazon, prime, Netflix and so on. Front cam could have been better as it’s not showing up true colors and contrast after the pic is clicked. 2 np Macro lens behind is useless. Amoled screen is very very good and sharp images and videos are displayed when you have a high speed broadband. Although I’m against Chinese brands, I did not have choice in the budget I had and Nord sort of checked all the boxes for me. Any non-Chinese brand coming up with good specs in limited budget then am all go for it. Until then will use Nord. Overall rating: 4 of 5"
541,Ashish R.,Missing some basic features,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well missing basic features of parallel app, no dual Sim, missing call recording although some video claim but unable to see sweeping left right. Phone is also bulky, using 5T for a long time and not impressed with it. It may be a good one for new phone users but a clear cut in features of a good premium phone. I am trying to return the phone but Amazon arrange a technician to visit to check missing dual Sim, parallel app and recording features. A clear no go from my side. Yes may be good for a first time buyer"
542,Supriya,Dont expect more,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  First i have many expectations on nord,may be  because of those expectations i am not so satisfied with the product.but for this price u can try other mobiles. I couldn't listen my phone ring if i am little far away from it.but when I play songs in it,the sound quality is good enough.as the ram is 12 gb its fast enough.when its about cam quality not as good as flagship phones. The micro lens is  not at all good as its just 2mp.Those who want to own oneplus but have less budget can go with this but have to sacrifice some considerations like camera quality...,ring quality.This review was written after using it for one month. The battery life is awesome after its fully charged it can be used continuously for 6 to 7 hours..and it also take very less to time charge as its a warp charging.27% charged in 10 mins nearly(23 to 50)"
543,Saurabh,Overall phone is good except battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall the phone is good. I think there is some battery issue... battery drains rapidly... after full charge it last for only 15 hr with normal usuage.I not even play high graphics game like pubg, call of duty etc if I do so then how long battery last I doubt."
544,arjun chawla,Honest Review,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was using oneplus6, thought it would be an upgrade with not much investment. On the contrary i felt i've downgraded. Otherwise a good phone for first time oneplus users who r planning spend 25-30k. Very poor camera, either oneplus is cheating by saying its the same camera from oneplus8 or oneplus 8's camera is very poor. Did'nt feel quality and sturdiness. My initial plan was to sell my oneplus 6, but i ended up selling the new nord, You can imagine the resentment i had after buying oneplus NORD.....I recommend oneplus users not buy NORD, INSTEAD go for oneplus 8/7/7T."
545,Nirmal,Review after 2 days usage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was looking for a budget phone under 30k after analysing some of the model finally I ordered OnePlus Nord  Amazon delivery was amazing delivered the product one day beforePros1. Good display really enjoying 90hrz refresh rate it's make a good feel when you watch Netflix hd movies2. Main features I loved most is OnePlus UI it's very clean and crisp compares other Android phone UIs ( Samsung and other Chinese phones)3. Processing is pretty decent not felt any lag or freezing issue ( not a gamer mostly uses office applications and social media and online streaming apps)4. Built quantity is very good you can feel it when you hold the phone , very good weight balance as per the size of the screen5. No heating issue while long duration calls and online meeting sCos1. OnePlus is Chinese company.  as I said I was looking for below 30k phone and I don't find any better suit in the market I have tried Samsung m30s and a51 in couple of weeks but both phone has lot of issue including software bugs and heating issue"
546,Arun Manikandan,Nord is a good phone but,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  No product is perfect and the same applies to this phoneColour shifiting in display is very prominent and annoying when viewing content in white backgroundLoud speaker is loud but lacks clarity and punchFingerprint sensor is unreliable sometimesCamera is good but not the bestVibration motor is lacking qualityEverything other than these are goodGood smooth display, software, reliable performance, Good one day battery life for an average user etc."

548,Ash omkar YT,"""Heavy"" phone with perfect balancing of weight",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. An coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed...."
549,Shridhar,Average Performance with high Price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Costly as per Indian market as oneplus charging 5k extra for their brand name .My bottomline is price if you are oneplus lover than go for it . Most of review by certified buyer's are almost true about camera , performance and battery are average and 5 G is Future till than there will be lot of coming in Indian market.6G 199998GB  2299912GB 24999"
550,Rahul Kumar,Okayish phone.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Nothing outstanding for the price. Okayish phone for a slightly steep price.Feels a bit heavy in the hand. In screen fingerprint reader not a good as a physical one. Awkward aspect ratio. Slightly on the taller side doesn't make for a good viewing experience. Can skip this one.

553,manish bisen,Good budget phone 👍,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Reviewing after 2 days. It's good budget phone. But better than MI Realme Samsung.Might be they brands can give you more features in this range. But we all know all brands mobile performance slow after 1 year.But it's one plus brand it runs smoothly even after 2 year.Now pointing on this Nord -Back cemera is good but front cemera could be more better.Battery is pretty good not too. Because 90HZ phone so battery drain sure will.If you customize your mobile in 60 HZ so ur battery gives more life.Speaker so good.Bluetooth connectivity amazing.Ram adjustment nicely.Handy phone, smart access. Look premium.Overall I'll give 4 star.Main things that phone customization is too good.Best for multitasking.No heating issue.One thing I'll clear now. Whenever u buy new phone and then do on that phone. Every phone will heat first time or 1 days at least because their parts are start now to run. So don't tremble for heating issue."
554,Deepak Chauhan,Premium Feeling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing a review after using this OnePlus Nord for 5 days high usage.First of all it's look like premium mobile (ignore frame as most of users will use protective case). In normal usage it gives about 1.5 day battery usage and in high usage it gives approx 1 day battery backup. I didn't notice any issue regarding display even in very low and high brightness as many of users reported.Pros.1. Battery backup is awesome2. Looks premium3. Smooth display4. Camera is good5. No bloatwares & ads6. No stereo speaker but speaker is loud and clear7. Good video viewing experienceCons.1. Very fews apps are supported in Parallel Apps2. Camera is struggling in low light3. Depth sensor and macro sensor cameras are worst. No meaning of this sensor and I don't know why they add this camera, just for quad camera setup.I will update this review after using this device for few more days and sure update soon if I notice any issue."

556,mohammed rafi,Display issue in just 3 weeks and Worst Online Support,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display Issue: The phone (Nord, 12 GB / 256 GB) was working fine till 3 weeks, yesterday suddenly one white line appeared in the center of the phone and heated up.  After reboot the phone screen is now red in colour and phone heat is very high. I saw several screen issues for the Nord phone. So please check before you buy.Support Issue: When I tried to contact the support number (4 times I tried) which was not attending even after waiting for 15+mins, no reply from support mail box and after waiting 20 mins in support chat I could talk to a executive and he told me to visit nearest service center which is 80km far from here. Online support is very worst and support centers are less. If you are not in a metro town / city, please check the service center availability before you buy the phone."
557,Shan,"Very disappointed with delete very , Product is ok",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very disappointed with delivery , I placed pre order on 28th July & received the package after 15 days , very poor delivery experience People who ordered on 06th August that too with 10% discount in price has recently v d product in 3 days,  When contacted Amazon clarifies that shipment is based on delivery date & not order date .This is a major flaw in their systemProduct : it's an average product don't expect too much as it was hyped , Display is ok & watching movies want that great , refresh rate is ok , camera quality is not bad but it would have been better , for 28k it's overly priced accept 5G spec , it's in par with 15k Realme XT"
558,Souteyo B.,Preety Good if you are a normal user...,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I order the device in Amazon around 6th of August and got the Device on 19th August..Till date I have received 2 ota updates 1 during the day I have unbox and the last one few days back...CAMERA: The camera of this device Is far better than my previous device,Captures decent photographs through primary camera and Depth camera I think is of no use because I have tried clicking photos multiple times covering the depth sensor of the device but that didn't help..The primary camera gets the work done relating to portrait images.. I don't understand why they gave the quad camera set up.. Macro camera performance is below average according to 28k phoneDisplay: Very smooth in 90HZ refresh rateBattery:improved after the update I got few days backPerformance:It is great according to me no lag(well I don't play Pub-g)Well a very decent device according to the need..If the update fixes issue of the camera it will be very helpful"
559,priti priyam,Very poor quality phone. It started hanging and apps get crashed. Not suggested at all.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just after 2-3 days it started hanging and most of the app gets crashed and phone gets rebooted automatically.  Battery back up is also very poor. when i contacted the customer care of oneplus, they sent some setups but it did not work.  Then they suggested to contact service center.  I contacted service center they told that its a software problem and they reinstalled teh software.  But even after that the same problem persists.I mailed to oneplus for the replacement on which they said to contact amazon.  But in amazon it shows that return period is over.  So this is the punishment i am getting for trusting oneplus brand and after spending 30000 I am being tortured and feeling cheated.  I would once again request oneplus and amazon to replace my phone with new one or refund my money."
560,Kumar,In par with budget with minute backlogs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.Finger print reader and face recognition is on mark! Work ultimately and can assure that none of the phones with similar budget can't provide with same work2. Battery life is kind of average. However it can be compensated by fast warp charger which can charge within half an hr. It better to carry a charger when you travel.3. Camera quality is also kind of average. Comparatively I feel one plus 6 camera works well.4. Phone touch and performance are class like all one plus phones give.Totally, A person who needs phone casually can buy this( a good option). Its not recommendatory for those who uses phone continually with little pauses and who is kind of phone photographers."
561,Riyaz,INTERNET DATA CINNECTIVITY ISSUE,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Please search for mobile issue in google before you buy,  there has been a ton of connectivity issues from many nord users including mine. AND NONE OF SO CALLED AUTHENTIC TECH REVEIWERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS IS INTO GENERAL PEOPLES ATTENTION.I am not recieving 4g internet speed on oneplus,  this is network coverage issue as i hv been using same sim on lg g6 which gave a super high speeed 4g connection.On top of it,  unable to connect to games like free fire,  it ahow network connection error,  but i switch to wifi,  it connects seamlessly.I am planning to return the device,  i am waiting hear back from oneplus."
562,Ramesh Gupta,Phone is continuously getting hanged,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Guys, be careful with the low end phone of OnePlus.  It is keep on getting hanged.  Network getting disconnected while talking.  Wifi is not detecting many a times.I used oneplus 3t for 3 years.  Decided to upgrade with this model, but turned to be a great downgrade.  I posted in OnePlus forums.  No response.  Be cautious!Poor performance from Service center.  I have raised the complaint again."
563,belal,cons. and pros.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  after a week of use here are some pros ans cons,cons1. no 3.5 mm jack2. sound quality is above average nt the best in range3. rear and selfie camera is quite good bt at this price range we have better option (about image quality).pros.1. video quality is awsm2. battry life is good, and can charge 20-100% in less than 40 min( charging speed mast hai)3. 765G works best, no lagging .4.screen is the best part u will notice, i mean very fluid type its jst feel like its flowing at 90htz.5. above all its very handy and looks very luxurious.6. noise cancellation tagda hai, mic is also goodin my view its one of the best phone under 30k . go for it,hype bahut tha bt aisa b nahi ki hype galat tha, go for it.😁👍"
564,Vishal Gajavelly,Overall it's a good purchase,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I am satisfied with the product.The performance is amazing so is battery life. Gaming is decent. The Backside glass material is very attractive and gives you a premium feel.Here come a few minor cuts they have made, the camera is an average especially micro cam, if you compare with the recently released pixel which is of similar price rate. The display is good but not the 'The Best'. The frame material of the mobile is plastic, so be a little careful if you wanna use it without a case. These are minor issues. For a normal user, majority don't notice.But if you are a frequent or a passionate photographer, I think you would be a lit bit disappointed. Or if you a hardcore gamer, I think there are better mobiles in the market.But I can assure you that it balances all the features you want to find in today's smartphone. If you are buying in 2020 it is 'The best' overall purchase in its price range."
565,Shefali Jain,"Very cheap quality phone, Camera seems like VGA",1.0 out of 5 stars,  After using this phone I realized that my previous phone which I bought 3 years back is much better.  2 major concerns that I found were an extremely bad camera and screen. My regular phone which has a 60hz refresh rate has a much much better display. Seems like OnePlus used some very cheap quality products and got this out so that people realize that OnePlus 8 is really worth it.
566,Parboti D.,"FLAGSHIP CAM OF ONEPLUS 8,60HZ IS ALSO SMOOTH",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am giving my honest review after 1 week1)The camera is super awesome far far best from my expectations,at first i was also confused whether the camera wiill be good or not...but trust me the selfie and rear camera are performing as oneplus 8 (as my freind also use OnePlus 8 so i have compared)2.even when i use the phone in 60Hz it feels like i am using in 90 hz its too smooth in 60hz to  No doubt the phone is super awesome idk why people are giving bad review3.THERE IS NO GREEN TINT ISSUE AT ALL"
567,RAJADURAI,Nice Product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice Product.Review After using 8 Days.Pros:* Amoled Display is awesome.* Fingerprint Reader works super fast.* Battery Life is very good. Normal usage it can use upto 1.5 Days.* Camara Quality good both front and Back.( Portrait, Normal Photo, Nightscape, PRO mode) Update immediately received for Camara Quality Improvement.* PUBG/COD No lagging upto HD.* If u r a Gamer Use fnatic mode for better gaming performance.* Phone Looks Premium.* Call Quality is good.Cons:* PUBG/COD light heating while played in HD.* Auto Call recording option not available.* Contact Search Option need improve.Oveall Good Phone in this price and Segment 12GB RAM and 256GB Memory."
568,Amrathesh,Worst camera.. Update or return money..,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  *Very disappointed with camera, macro camera not working properly. Front camera gives more bright pic which looks high contrast.*Videography is excellent with same camera......*Waiting for camera updates from oneplus community....."
569,Tushar Meshram,Worth to buy but I got damage piece,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Overall specification worth to the price as compare to same budget mobiles.. No issues with mobile camera is good and display is working smooth.. but facing network issue..  after every 5-6 hours network automatically gone.. every time need to put sim into sim tray.
570,Sailaja,Premium at price point! Worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using it for about 3days, i didnot face any battery draining issues, but i came accross green and purple tint when I use it on night mode,but it's not a big deal for me bcz I don't use dark mode much! Coming to gaming I played pubg it ran fine and there is no heating issues while gaming!Cameras are good but still have to be the best as they mentioned!Display is gorgeous and looks premium while holding it on hands(Plastic frame u may not notice that)Coming to oxygen os is the best Ui I had ever used, it is smooth, snappy and well optimized! Oxygen os coupled with 8Gb of ram and that 90hz amoled panel makes the device fast and smooth... Overall for daily drivers it is the best device at that price!"
571,Siddhant Sharma,Premium for Everyone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Nord disappointed me at the beggining, but with every update the phone started showing its true potential. With a decent battery life, which is not a problem because of the Dash Charge the phone works fine throughout the day. The main camera is the USP of this device, which works perfectly fine for me, (have a attached a few images testing the various features of the camera) the remaining cameras are also showing improvement with each update, but it may take some time to be as perfect as the main 48MP camera taken from the OnePlus 8. Overall the phone is near to perfect at this price point and the 12GB RAM + 256GB space is definitely a banger packed in a beautifully crafted phone."
572,Anoop Kaur,Worth the money 💰 but not without it's flaws.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall the build and form factor feels good in hand. love the one plus' minimal UI. It's super fast and fluid, no bloatware whatsoever.The camera is sorta decent, not too good but not half bad either (see the attached photo for example)Battery life is a little bit disappointig. it charges extremely quickly but doesn't last a whole day.90Hz display is definitely one of it's best features that you gotta try.Overall it's a good looking phone with tons of great features and a couple of it's things that being it down.If you can overlook the battery life and you are not a pro at photography then you should definitely go for this."
573,Alan,A well rounded phone for the budget.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall its a good product with little tweaks here and there.Very much sufficient and smooth for normal usage.For camera, the main 48 MP sensor is good. I was able to get some good quality pictures in good lighting. The front camera is also really good.An unnecessary 2MP macro camera.Face Unlock is quick, but the Fingerprint reader is a bit slow.During the first usage after unboxing, the phone heated up pretty significantly, but the problem subsided during succesive uses and now its runs with a minimum heating.Battery life is good enough to get you through a 9-10 hr screen time ( not gaming) and the 30W warp charger delivers as promised.At low brightness in dark background there is a purple tint on the bottom part of the display. But its not that bad, and is not visible while watching videos or other media content."
574,Afnas Aboobacker,MY DREAM COME TRUE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I always dreamed about owning a one plus device and one plus had my dream come true.Took a long time time to get my phone but it was worth the wait.Had no tint issue or any other complaints,I think they have fixed these issues in the coming phones.90 hz refresh is so smooth,camera quality is great except for the macro camera but no big deal.Have some improvements to me made in the camera department and one plus is working on it.Gaming was smooth and one plus has guaranteed a higher settings in pubg in their future updats.Amalod screen is great.Got two updates.Battery back up has improved,also improved night shots of front camera.Oxegen OS is the best part no ads and smooth experience with good customisations and features.I know it's frame is made out of plastic but doesn't feel cheap.Will be updating more details regarding this phone.Its a balance phone.Perfect for all use🥰🥰🥰.By the way thank you Amazon and One plus"

576,Delta,Tint issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Tint issue is there. Tint issue is specifically on gey and black color and is noticeable on every brightness level. Disappointed from OnePlus display issue.
577,Rehan Akhtar,"Battery life, user experience, camera, Gcam, tint issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good phone. Nothing unique, above average battery life, decent user experience and good display. The tint can be noticed when something dark grey appears, like a blank chrome page. When something absolutely black appears, no tint issue can be noticed. The camera is good, primary, wide and front. Pictures are colour accurate and detailed but sometimes turn out  to be a bit over exposed and white balance is inconsistent. I tried using Gcam, it produced a better results comparatively. But the OnePlus camera at its own is still good. The fingerprint reader is fast enough and face ID too. You will need to unlocks some features for more smoother experience. I will definitely recommend this phone for content consumption, camera and casual gaming."
578,Tony Mathew Abraham ,Not your ordinary OnePlus device - for a good reason,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got the device today in the afternoon - it's been a beast so far :D.Fingerprint reader works fine, and I'm yet to completely test the battery life. The 90Hz AMOLED display is a sweet addition to this device for this price point.The Onyx Gray looks and feels premium, atleast for the sub-30k price point. And the 12GB of RAM nakes the phone blazing fast, atleast fresh out of the box.The packaging beats the likes of premium OnePlus devices, and the mix of Black and Teal is a welcome combination.So far, it's been a good experience with this device."
579,Jabir P,My personal review after 2 week usage of nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  For me its a budget friendly phone..I think it is the king of mid ranger phone... That is I used many mid ranged phone .. but I didn't got this much performance.The camera quality is above average and battery life is perfect for movie lover, normal use like calling, wsp, insta, etcFingerprint reader is so fast and awesomeIn my opinion if you have 30k rs you should look for the high variant of 12GB/256GB RAM and internal storage respectively.. Also didn't face any tint issue or bluetooth, wifi issues that are just gimmicks.. Just go buy yaar you will love it.."
580,Vineeth kumar,Descent mobile - should have been better!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Display1. Good amoled display with 90hz refresh rate,but not the best in this price segmentCamera1. good shots with the primary camera in all lighting conditions2. Descent wide angle shots, most of the times images are pretty soft3. Primary 32mp selfie camera is average, overexposes the image, ultrawide camera is useful4. No need to mention the remaining two cameras, straight up trashCharging is speed is very good, full charge around 1hrBattery lasts more than a day with 90hz mode765g Processor is good enough, multitasking is a breeze, don't know how it works with gamingBig thumbs up for oxygen OS, clean software experience"
581,Sonali Gandhi,Worth a buy!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the product in 4 days.The product got so much hype that I was forced to buy this. Especially this blue marble colour with glass at the back is so mesmerizing.Good battery life, i just charge it once in a day and it goes on with moderate usage.30W charging just makes it charge 70% in 35 minutes approx.Camera quality is awesome but micro camera and depth sensor is just a waste. They could have applied that cost in making ultrawide better but after considering all the facts, the phone is worth a buy for this cost you are getting a good brand good battery life, 48mp main camera which makes your experience better, especially 5g support and chipset does not make you feel behind any flagship model. Also it shows a very good quality in nightscape mode.So its a buy rating from my end but I am giving 4 stars bcz of micro camera."
582,Priya Mishra,FACTORY RESET HAPPENED AUTOMATICALLY,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing this review after using it for about a month..The phone was working well until today when it started to do a factory reset ON ITS OWN..I have read a feedback of one customer complaining the same issue..ONE PLUS PLEASE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE..camera is good..finger sensor is working properly...overall phone is good..if one plus team resolves this issue then it would a great phone to use for couple of years...
583,Amazon Customer,"Bad camera quality, don't fall for brand names",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very much excited to get this product, but I'm feeling bad for choosing this mobile as it has more cons than pro's.Camera quality is very bad, the first thing I did after switching on the phone was to click a picture and was very much disappointed with the image captured. A cheaper phone would take nicer pictures. Also the image saving takes a second or so gap, so finding it difficult to capture moving objectsApps are hanging a lot while using multiple applications at same time. Screen is getting frozen for few seconds (15-20) and as a fast hand person I feel very much frustrated.Not a mobile expected from one plus. I fell for the brand name, and it's a life time lesson.I don't recommend this mobile if you expect good speed and good camera quality. Other than these features I didn't expect anything else from one plus brand."
584,Siva R,Stop letting us use gcam 🤦🏻‍♂️,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I trusted oneplus for future updates for camera hence i haven't returned the nord mobile. They provided the update but whats the use. Iam expecting atleast oneplus 5t camera quality in this nord. Please don't let us use gcam mod, we all buying your mobile mainly for stock camera.Expecting future camera updates or else i will broke my nord to make video because of camera disappointment."

586,Pratham K.,Love the oxygen os.... The best thing in the phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone looks super premium in hand, This phone is good for the people who aren't heavy gamers, 0 bloatwares, 90hz refresh rate amoled display is super smooth. Brightness is really good, camera image processing is little late can be fix through updates, oxygen os is the best thing in OnePlus phones one can get, charging speed is super fast can fully charge phone in less than 1 & half hour. Overall it's awsum...."
587,Animesh ,Pretty impressive,5.0 out of 5 stars,  One plus Nord is really an impressive phone with a relly good price.The camera is amazingThe only thing that lags this phone is the battery life which is quite fine but could have been a lot better.Fingerprint scanner is Okay.You really can say that -This phone is everything you could ask for at a really good price.
588,S Senthilkumar,"Shorter battery, longer heat issue for short usage",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst battery life, it is not even withstanding a day thogh only used for minimal usage, never gone for gaming, video streaming still battery drains drastically, I need a replacement.Another big drawback is heating issue, heating for normal 3seconds call, I have never faced this issue in my earlier phones ...verybad experience with nord... Disappointed, lot of hypes in the phone, it is normal another phone with 5g technology(don't know about 5G compatibility only we know when started using 5G, they sold and earned profilt)Only camera quality is good.."

590,satish kumar,Average Camera and low battery,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Updating my review after 45days of usage.Pros:1) Awesome look and feel2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate3) Sound quality is good4) Premium design5) Fast on screen Fingerprint scanner6) Quick charging7) No heating issuesCons:1) Average camera -- not expected at this price range (28K)2) No support to headphones Jack (now a days everyone is using bluetooth devices so its not a big issue)3) No led notification light4) Battery backup is low (Highly not recommended for gamers)
591,Rakshitha,Best phone by OnePlus in midrange,5.0 out of 5 stars,  * Battery : Initial days the battery was draining really fast but with continuous updates from OnePlus my battery lasts for atleast a day* Camera : About the camera I see many comments stating that the quality is not good but In my opinion due to the updates given by OnePlus the camera quality has improved and it's best* Finger print sensor is fast* There no display issues like tint*Best ram managementConclusion:  OnePlus has done 283 optimization and it is continuing to do the optimization so in my opinion oneplus has the best service and they listen to their customers every time !Overall it's a best phone
592,Shubham Magidwar,The Best all in one Product💙,5.0 out of 5 stars,  So I have bought this phone straight after my one plus 6 experience. This is the phone which I was looking to buy. Firstly I loved the color as it looks preety cool(my fav as well). Talking about the phone I am really loving it each & every day. No doubt about the quality & also the storage is Good. Camera quality is great with a different level of experience. If you are looking for the best phone with a satisfying price you must go for ONEPLUS NORD ! 💙
593,Vaibhav Wardole,Everything is average and Surely not value for money,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There's nothing's great as such.First of all I had to Wait for almost 25 days to get it😑 So first they hiked your curiosity so that you would feel like it'll be such a great phone but intact I was pretty disappointed with it. Camera is averageAnd it heats up so quickly. Battery is not enough , drains out very quickly.I just unboxed it , it was at 48 and just after 10 mins without even playing any high end content or gaming, only few clicks and lil bit browsing the juice went down to 35 , seriously.Not sure it's because of that 90 Hz refresh rate which I didn't feel anything different.Overall I would say does not meet expectations and not worth to wait for months to get it."
594,Deepak Chauhan,Try your luck,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is decent but the price is a bit more looking at the specifications they provide on paper vs the actual performance you get.I replaced my Nord in 2 days as the display apart from showing green and pink tint even on brightness above 50 percent exhibits a dark purple patch that was affecting my daily day to day usage.You'll be lucky if your unit is not plagued by such display issues.Cameras are not even average they lack focus and clarity even in full lighting, but that can be improved via Software updates.But tinting issue can't be fixed with a software update."
595,Swami,Excellent Performance...765..SD and Fluid Amoled Display,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome mobile in this mid range segment..Excellent display..wonderful camera..sleek and light weight design..Overall a quality product from OnePlus..Actually I don't like very big screen mobiles..Since it's a 6.44 inch..light weight..compact design...Five stars to OnePlus Nord
596,Saptak  Kulkarni,Overall a good package,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my delivery on 26th...so have been testing is for 4 days now...and it works absolutely fine...I didn't find any problems...(those having display tint issue they will be fixing it in next update)Camera I would rate it 4 out of 5...macro is ok and overall camera is good...with some upcoming updates it should be good EnoughPerformance wise is quick damn quick...i play PUBG a lot it there not delay at all...and the extreme setting is soon gonna come...I didn't face any issues while calling, connecting bluetooth headphone it works absolutely fineBattery is also good idk why people are saying bad battery performance but it's more than enough...and Charing it also pretty fastAnd this phone is quite handy not too big or heavy..."
597,Priyank Deshmukh,Great overall package - Camera could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros : -Great amoled panel with 90hz display.Bloatware free Oxygen OS with 3 years of updates.Sufficient battery. 30t warp charger.No heating issues while long hours of gaming.765g processor for smooth daily usage and gaming.Gorilla glass in front and back which gives it a premium look.Cons:-Dissapointing cameras. May be it can be fixed with further updates.Plastic frame which may lead to durability issue. This can be confirmed only after long usage (more than a year or two).No 3.5 mm jack.
598,Aditya,Best you can get but be patient with Oxygen OS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Best value for money. With frequent updates sometimes Oxygen OS becomes buggy such as Google can't connect to internet problem, Google Chrome doesn't load search results, Google Web search and define on a selected word doesn't work properly (shows no internet). These are some issues I faced, which I did not faced other phones having Google."
599,Se,Best phone in this price range!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was a bit worried to buy this phone as I had never had a one plus before. My husband has a S10 and I an iPhone XS MAX. I have to say for the price I paid for this the screen is great, the speed is fantastic. The colour is one of the things that I really liked about the phone and I also got the sandstone blue case from one plus which lets me see the blue colour of my phone with some protection. The camera is alright. It hasface and fingerprint scanners. Bluetooth works well. Also it feels very light after my XS Max. Very happy with the purchase.."
600,Deepak,Below Average product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Better option available in this price range.  Very dull screen low speaker volume. An average product not happy at allPlanning to sell this on cashify.
601,Vinayak,Decent Phone for Normal Users. Camera Enthusiast's stay away.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I booked the phone the day it was released and have been using for a week and sharing my experience below,1) Decent phone and good specs. No tint issue was scared on that front2) Camera realistically 4 wasn't required and could have been better3)Battery : As much  as it charges fast it also drains faster.Kind of neutral havent had a chance to go out a whole day or two to test its endurance .4)Used one plus 6T so OS experience nothing much to comment it is really good.5)Simple and powerful processor ,i am a normal user with phone calls ,news and video skimming so the processor and RAM is giving similar experience to that of flagship model.6)"
602,Sandeep Gaur,Don't buy poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have very surprised why people have written good mobile.1. Mobile have heating problem2. Camera quality very poor3. Product not as per discribed4. We are trying to return/replace the item but no one wants to listen my word, it seems that I have to bear Rs.28000/-5. Amazon Customer executives are not responding and till date they have not resolved the issue and also does not want to hear my problem.Overall mobile quality is very poor and I have purchased 1st time oneplus mobile and this is last."
603,V.MADHUSUDHANA,A great phone that is overpriced and wayyy overhyped,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Slightly overpriced for what it offers. Unnecessary depth and macro cams at the back. Great screen and got no tint issues. Mono speaker setup is good but stereo should have been given at this price point. So in a nutshell, a nice phone that is overpriced and wayyy overhyped.PS:One plus marketing team needs to chill and not create unnecessary hype as it can quickly backfire."

607,Sandeep,Camera is worst,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I usually don't write reviews but this I'll as it might help someone. Camera quality is the worst I've seen so far. Color capturing not good, something I didn't expected from giant like OnePlus. Also zoom distorts the image  With this price they should have given us good/average camera. If you want your phone camera to be good then trust me this is not the phone you should buy."

609,Narender kumar,Wastage of money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It drains the battery very fast. It consumes 10-15% battery during your sleeping hours when not in use.During call receiving or calling someone, both the sim cards loses its connectivity. You have to try 4-5 times to call somebody. That's the most irritating thing.Camera is so so . Problem occurs during night or when there is low light.I will prefer not to buy this product."
610,Saleemnurubasha,Great Device for day to day tasks..,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Upgraded from realme 1 this is first time owning a Oneplus brand phone.Booked on August 6th during prime day and received on 28th August  .Almost after 10days of usage writing this review .Looks wise amazing no doubt it will give premium feel in hand and it won't feel bulky.I am not Gamer so please don't consider my review if your preference is games. Battery performance is fine with one full charge giving day full of performance watching atleast 2 and half hrs of movie/webseries on prime or Netflix(excellent HD streaming), and not less than 1hr online video conference and some office work.Need little improvement in camera department. Sound quality also descent.Oxygen OS is very smooth and fast.Overall  experience with Nord is great."

Zoom quality is ok.Front camera is bad. Pixels gone busted when you zoom the imagesFacing hardware problems like hanging the apps and stops working. Not good for multitasking.Overall just ok, not as good as described.No automatic call recording option."
612,ashit kumar,Review for one plus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am writing review after 15 days of use.first thanks to amozon for its quick delivery and that was 3 days before. I found phone very smooth and flawless. Awesome quality camera especially it's macro and it's 10 x zoom. Sound quality suprb. Charging is also very fast , thanks to its wrap charger. Obviously you will be disappointed if you compare it with one plus 7t pro or samsung 20 plus or note 10. But better than I phone 7 or 8 . You don't need to buy cover or screen gaurd as it comes along with mobile."
613,Rahul Dholam,Totally worth the bucks!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my OnePlus Nord yesterday. The very first day I checked my phone was for the green tint issue. The following night when I checked my phone, I see no green-pink tint issue in it. Also the black bar on the top through the punch holes cameras, aren't that visible. Like they get easily hidden away unless you intentionally look for it. Others things like the fingerprint reader and battery life are good and up to mark. About camera quality, I personally would say it as okay. Not impressed very much by camera quality or maybe I need to discover it much further to explore its quality. And the 90hz screen, overall processing and haptics are all good. For me, this phone is near to perfect for which I would give it a 5 star rating."
614,adithya,A trustable mid range phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The oxygen os is very smooth,gaming experience is good so far ,the os is highly customisable.I didn't observe any tint issue so far.Amazon delivery was very good with neat proctective packaging.Totally a nice phone for balanced users like me.Battery lasts for 1day after full chrage I get a screen time of 6hours easily with 90hz referesh rate.No heating issues . Continuous updates are given to fix bugs.Camera captures live colours and you can take insane shots with g cam.Build quality of the phone is pretty normal so put a  full tempered and a case and use it.The only problem that is personally face is no 3.5mm audio  jackCharge speed is super fast as claimed by the company"
615,LeeJay Giri,My experience with Nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,   I pre-ordered it and I got and I'm telling my view after good usage..Excellent phone...go for it.. features are really cool... premium experience..all the description given for the phone totally matches with the product..the only issue I've felt was the battery..charge drains a little faster in normal mode but thanks to the fast warp charge it gets charged in a very short time.camera quality is good but the macro was not good enough.. except this overall a good phone and worth the price
616,Sony,Delivered on 15th day after the order,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery: I ordered this product on the 20th of August, and it was supposed to deliver on the 29th of August. But the item was shipped on 28th, and it was delivered on 4th of September. Customer care service provided uncertain information whenever contacted. Waiting for a product for almost half a month is just a waste of time and money.After two days of using, I find the product is reliable.Camera is too good.Battery does not hold the charge even for a day.Charging speed is slower than my moto turbo."
617,Heera,Good phone but could have been better!,4.0 out of 5 stars,   Over all it's a decent phone for this price. Great for someone who is looking forward to buy one plus. Oxygen OS is super smooth. One thing I really like is the filters in camera. They are doing a great job.Here are the cons I noticed:1. Front camera smoothens out everything. Images not that sharp.2. Whenever I search something on Google it shows offline though signal is quite good. If I redo the search twice or thrice it then gives the result.3. Face unlock doesn't work properly in dim light.4. Only 2 system provided font styles. One plus could have included few more fonts atleast.Apart from these down points the phone is a snatch.
618,Mohammad Ahmad,Average Phone for Average User,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  One plus Nord is an average phone. With everything second best, screen is 90 Hz and is smooth but colours aren’t  so Punchy.Camera is also average, front camera softs and ruins pictures by AI, could be fixed by software let’s see.My variant has 12 Gb of ram but works like it has less.Conclusion- Its really nice phone for average user but i will not recommend it for someone who is looking forward it for photography, or some serious usage."
619,Shubham Pardeshi,Below 30k 👌,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  In this price really good phone one plus launched. Buy One plus NORD if you are going to buy a new phone. I purchased this cause i wanna take online lectures for hours and tried its camera and other features, initially liked it."
620,Amazon Customer,A classy product!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A product which is excellent for the price it is at. Amother class creation from the 1 + stable ! Totally money's worth. Features are brilliant. However was left a bit disappointed when I discovered, it's only 1 sim phone and for head sets / earphones one has to order the earphones cable as the port has not been given. Overall the phone is really good."
621,Frederick Kostka,Seems like I Settled with the Nord. Disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  So disappointed with the Nord. After all the hype created by One plus, I feel like my basic Asus Zenphone from years ago is still better.I've had the phone for 3 days and already facing significant issues.The phone heats up significantly during minimal usage. And now even when idle.Lags while switching between apps (So much for 12GB RAM!)Screen freeze so I can't receive callsFront camera quality is averageCan't believe the Nord has such basic problems. Tried connecting with their team but no response. Need a replacement or refund as it's definitely not worth 30k."
622,devesh,Awesome phone and dam good looking in blue color I loved it so much😊😍🥳🥳,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome experience with this phoneOnly 2 things I don't like this phoneOne is front camera in low light is not good & 2nd one is pubg smooth extreme setting didn't get hdr alsoOther than that phone is good and amazing experience you will get and I didn't get any display greentint issueDisplay is awesome and onemore main thing the phone is looking dam beautiful in blue colour I loved it blue colour I think it is the best colour I have ever seen 😊😍🥰
623,varat7v2,Felt like over-priced as compared to others.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like its light-weight and comfortable design; its very easy to use all of its button and screen with single hand. However, looking at the price, I didn't like its camera quality and battery. One plus 6 was better than this though it was just 2-3K higher than this phone. I would say looking at its overall quality, its definitely over-hiked phone. I think we can get phone with equivalent features at 15-18K of another brands. I am very disappointed with its poor camera quality, as I just picked this up - thinking camera would be good compared to others phone."
624,Trushti   patel,Fingerprint and Face unlock is completely worst...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Within 5 days I am facing problem with finger print scanner it's not not working completely, worst fingerprint and face unlock scanner not expected in OnePlus atleast...Even one plus 6 is better than one plus nord which I used previously....Result of camera is not upto the mark.Auto call recording is also not available in this phone"
625,Gurmeet Dhaliwal,Amazing camera phone one plus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really loved the new one plus nord phone .. camera quality is simply amazing .sharing few pictures for reference purposes. Battery life is also too good..very light and simply amazing gadget.  As a content creator ,my focus is always towards a good camera quality nd clear videos. Thank you one plus nord .."
626,prashant joshi,Nice Smooth Experience.....,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Satisfied with this product....Many people will think that there are other better option for this price range in market according to specs....But this Oneplus Nord is a balanced package with the best ui(Oxygen OS) which will give you nice experience.....The Processor 765g is descent in its work...I never got any problem while playing heavy games till now and I know I will not get a problem in future.....If you are a moderate gamer(not heavy gamer) and wanted pretty everything in a phone with OnePlus Branding than go for it.....
627,Akshay Govind,The perfect buy,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The unit that I received doesn't have the infamous display tint issue and the battery life is also excellent. Now the phone is running OOS 10.5.5 and I get an average of 7 to 8 hrs SOT with basic social media and youtube and not to mention I don't game in this phone and definitely no PUBG. Camera is not the best but sufficient for an average user like me and I believe it will be improved in the coming updates. Build quality is awesome and feels premium for a user upgrading from a below 20k phone. I use Vodadone and VoLTE isn't yet supported by vodafone for this model. It's an excellent choice if you want a premium experience under a budget.
628,Ankit raj,Super👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the biggest reasons to buy the OnePlus Nord is for the software experience. ... Other reasons to go for the OnePlus Nord include an affordable price tag, 5G support, and a great AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The build quality is excellent as well, as is the overall design of the handset."
629,bhuvan,Has Major Heating Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Imagine you’ve just purchased a 27k smartphone, initial days of it, not much screen time, no games installed just google maps, GPS that you use on your way to work and during that the phone heats up so bad that it gives heating alarm everyday within 30 mins of usage! Initially I thought it might be my car’s temperature in the morning hours but even in evening around 8 with just 30-45 mins of gps usage, boom temperature alert! Major Flaw I don’t know how people are keeping with it with higher screen time or maybe just issue with using gps but I had to eventually return it to amazon which was a smooth return and thanks to amazon for that."
630,Smit Modasiya,Good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Except camera quality everything is just good, there are quad camera setup but third camera from top to bottom it is never working neither in portrait mode or night mode or wide angle mode or normal camera, it just never used. I think it is kind of gimmick to show that four camera setup. Apart from this the Oxygen os is just awesome as always, battery is mediocre, it runs almost a day for me. I think black onyx is much better color then the blue marble, I purchased bluemarble and it looks nice and funcky but not decent. Onyx Black is much more decent."
631,mansha diggal,This phone is Ok. One,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Finger Print reader and face unlock are working very fast.Battery life is good.But Camera Quality made me disappointed. I Never expect that One Plus can give such a cheap quality of camera. When pictures clicked it looks like the mobile picture of 10k or 15k range. Slowmo camera of this phone is not working whenever I tried it it started dimmering. It seems one plus doesn't give much attention on this model and take it for granted. In the beginning I faced many bugs. Suddenly Mobile started to heat and battery was drained quickly, Pixels of picture was torn.Processor and performance of phone is good. But again I'll say worst camera.Lookwise this is good and lightweight."
632,Rajesh,Top in this time,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Many review I read and I was in tension.. but after reached my mobile I am very happy.. It's look very premium both front and rear side... camera, sound, display battery backup etc all are best... Only front camera need to improve and I request to  OnePlus company to improve portrait video as a oppo Reno  4...please go for it don't look negative comments ❤️❤️👍👍"
633,Shiva Shankar Panyam,Worst service from Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is a problem with blutooth connectivity, network connectivity and automatically mobile is getting switch off automatically I kept replacement but Amazon response was too worst I never expected such type of response, still they are not giving replacement for the mobile. Please Don't buy electronic products in Amazon ( worst service and response)."
634,Aayushi p.,"Small Budget, Big Packet",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:-Selfie Camera is awesome.RAM & External Memory are beast at this range.Sound Quality is bombardier.Look is too sexy.The back has a beautiful shine and lustrour.Cons:-No earphone jack, so no wired earphones.Back camera is a bit disappointing.Battery life isn't that powerful.All together it's a good into budget phone with a lot of features and a brand name.You can go for it, I promise it won't disappoint you."
635,Govind kendre,One plus nord...♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥,5.0 out of 5 stars,  After using more than week my final review about my one plus nord...♥️This is my honest review about this phoneCamera is decent that means more than avg 8/10Battery - 9/10OS- 10/10Performance -9/10Charging speed -10/10Speaker - very gudIf u want a overall Decent phone under 30 kNote- I'm not gamer that means if u considering for pubg and all heavy games it's not powerful as per other phones competitive phones who have 8 series SoC who did better performance as compared to this.Overall a great phone...if u love gud balanced smart phone with great Os 🔥🔥 and  more than decent performanceYou never regret after purchasing..
636,shankardev,Great hardware for the price; glitch in software. Hope these are taken care of in the update patches,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is a software (app or OS) glitch. The photo gallery just doesn’t open. I have to goto files and look at thumbnail views but cannot blow-up the pictures there either.SMS also has some issues.Even the backlight fluctuates in terms of brightness.Camera seems good, haven’t tried it for low light / nightscape yet. However, not sure how to access the third camera on the back (only have controls to 12 Mp and 48 MP camera)"
637,Avinash,Much needed mid-range entry from OnePlus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been loyal user of OnePlus from their very first product OnePlus One. Their devices are known for the sheer performances and crisp UI. And this hasn't disappointed either except macro camera.Forget about the negative reviews and take this phone for brilliant experience.
638,chandan kumar,Unable to create the magic this time.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been a one plus one user, and this phone stands nowhere close to it. Be it the design of the phone or the battery life. The processor is pretty good, the phone works very smoothly, and so is the face unlock display and finger sensor unlock. But battery sucks. The camera is not that good but is not that bad also.Overall I will rate this phone 4 stars. I hope that One plus may provide some updates to enhance both the battery life and the camera output. Till then 4 stars."
639,P.N.MURALI,I loved it !!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome, phone's really fast, charging is awesome its OnePlus after all, I need not say anything, u can just understand by how fast the stock got finished, durability of the phone is good(many said not soo good but I don't think so), made my life easy, camera got improved after update."
640,Amazon Customer,One plus nord got it after 15th day dead...,5.0 out of 5 stars,  28th July order the phone. Phone got it 25th August but I'm reviewing as on 16th day after.After 15th day  one Plus nord phone is completely dead.Yesterday(15th day) night that one is 85% charge but today morning phone is not working completely dead.So that's ma experience.So please try to another product or brands opted.  that's better...
641,Mohan sriram,Cool to have it,5.0 out of 5 stars,  To be frank the best budget phone that I could get on OnePlus..Seamless and very fast operations..Till a but having issue with the keypad..Camera quality is average..Not very great like other OnePlus and bettery life is good...Overall a budget friendly mobile from Oneplus
642,satish,Best quality with very reasonable price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Im proud holding and using this phone. Superb technology with stylish model.Im sure u love it.Dont go with negative reviews on camera or other quality parameters, pls buy it, u love it. ☺️"
643,Sukruthi,Not happy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Defective piece was delivered. Mobile is getting switched off randomly and after 15-20 mins its getting on. Still waiting for replacement.Finally received very bad customer service from amazon, not at all satisfied. Amzon is not taking the responsibility for the product."
644,Santosh Dash,best for price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The overall phone is great but the camera is not that good and if you are using 90hz then the battery will drain quickly thanks to wrap charge it charges 0 to 100 in 30 min.best part the screen is very good oxygen os is great and fingerprint works fast.avg gaming experience..
645,Pranav kumar,Nord is best,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after 10 days of purchase. This nord works absolutely fine in all conditions. Some of YouTubers said negative for views. Nord display colors r better than any of the IPS display phones n u can play games in HD with NO lags, even though camera also is well optimised (after yesterday's update) . Be FUTURE READY and NEVER SETTLE ❤️OnePlus."
646,Dev11,I'm providing some cons about phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  After one long week usage I found many bugs and many features are not present in this phone for name sake only one pluse here am listing out some cons1. If u use both sims and if u activate internet for sim1 and if u get call to to sim2 internet is disabling not even getting or unable to send normal msgs this is the biggest big. Earlier I was using redmik20pro and there is no this kind of problem2. If u disable whatsapp media visibility and try to download the images from chat it's not downloading.3. No Audio jack4. Network drop outs5. If u enable both fingerprint and face unlock face unlock is not working6. Battery also some what ok.
647,Afinas,Display Issue is REAL,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got my nord delivered yesterday and I have found colour fading at the bottom left corner of my screen mainly at the low brightness(very noticeable).
648,Ipsita sahu,Good phone but not the best as I thought,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Fingerprint reader was good.Battery life was not much good as I've expected.And another thing is the heating issue.The phone heats up while charging and the charger too heats up with the phone.Camera quality was good but the front camera video was not good.It is not having the mirror effect we can't change it on our choice.We can change it on oppo and realme phones but here in OnePlus there's no option available to change.It's default.And the last thing I would tell is that it's not having a SD Card support.It would be better if it would have SD Card Support.Overall I'll give 4 Star to this phone.It's a good phone but it's heating issues are a bit problematic for me.
649,Amazon Customer,Superb 👌,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Superb PhoneOnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000."
650,Apoorv,Green Tint On my Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Facing Green and pink tint on my phone... I know it's not a thing of big concern for many.. But believe me when you notice it once you won't get rid of it. It's hell annoying. After spending 30k (which is huge amount for me) I was not expecting this from OnePlus device.My only suggestion is.. if you can spend 5-6k more...then go for 7t.My feeling for nord is like...""Maza nhi aaya""I finally yesterday asked Amazon to replace the products . Now waiting for Amazon Technician. Fingure crossed"
651,Gipin antony joseph,MY REVIEW AFTER 2 WEEKS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good looking ! Weight is balanced overall everything is good except two major problems, tint issue is not a big deal in Ur daily usage!One major thing is camera:Don't expect much ,it's average, not very good, just good!The other is battery life:Thought would stand at least one day ,but it's hard unless we adjust to keep the charge for the whole day ...I mean not good for a full time user !Updates improved the camera section..but just a slight improvement!Battery is strong after half of of its charged is drainedAnd finger print is just good...!"
652,Gk,Not worth the price and the OnePlus brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone just 15 days ago but very disappointed.The sound quality is very poor , the voice on the call is very lowly heard. 1 GB RAM of apple is way better than 12GB RAM in this phone. The keypad does not pop up sometimes. The new phone battery survives for about 18 hrs on simple phone calls and normal work without any gaming or long videos. If you have couple of zoom calls it dries very fast"
653,RAKESH V,It's an Awesome phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Both the software and the hardware is of high quality. Camera is good and after the updates it's performance has increased and taking good photos and videos. Display is also very good and the processor is also performing without any lags. Battery lasts for 1 full day with heavy usage.
654,Kindle Customer,"Scratches and more scratches, even with gentle usage.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's been less than a month I bought this phone and there are already so many scratches on the phone. The screen is pathetic, it keeps attracting so much dust that I have to keep cleaning every one hour to have a clean screen. I am so disappointed with this phone, no value for money. Also another disadvantage cannot plug in head phones. As it was not enough to spend this amount for this useless phone now I have to spend a heavy amount for the ear buds. And everyone knows how horrible Amazon customer service is, they don't even consider customers as humans after 10 days of return window. For USA return window is 30 days, for India its 10 days. So much racism."
655,Omkar Rahate,"Best for speed & performance, camera is just satisfactory",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  - Great performance in case of multitasking and processing speed.- Overall feel handy and the weight distribution is great.- WRAP charging support works great.Cons:- Observed frequent Bluetooth interruptions while using 1+'s Bluetooth headsets- The DTMF/touchtones while calling is not working properly, whenever called to customer care found the issue that it's not detecting the keys which are pressed.Overall in case of speed and processing Nord is at its best, but if you are looking for a phone with a good camera then this may not be a great purchase for you."
656,Abhisek Thapa,Definitely to go for device.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I had been using a Redmi device for past three years and Nord feels like an amazing upgrade. The 90 Hz screen is a visual treat and the camera quality is good. My battery life is usually 8 to 9 hours as I am a heavy user but 30 W charger is quite fast. I can play games without a hitch and browse Instagram with a lot ease and grace. I really recommend this to all those who can afford it as it is a future proof device.
657,Amazon Customer,Good phone but....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1. Oxygen OS2. Battery life3. Warp ChargeCons:1. Display tint2. Camera below par except the main cameras on both front and backBuy this phone for regular usage and the performance will be as expected from a OnePlus device, smooth. The display does have tinting issues, which might or might not be resolved through OTA updates. The cameras barring the main sensors are below par. The fingerprint reader is quick and recognises almost everytime. The battery can easily last a day under normal usage.Considering Oxygen OS11 will deviate from stock Android UI , might have to think twice before buying."
658,Sarin,Not worth the price,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using one plus 3 from past 4 years. By expecting same quality and features ordered the phone and very much disappointed with the quality and the performance. Camera is just like any other Chinese phones and it has so much whitening effects and low quality. Battery is draining so fast and after the os update it became little better. This phone is not worth the price and cannot be compared with the previous one plus mobiles
659,Dhanesh,Avoid very ordinary phone only advantage being 5g ready,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kind of fat ,heavy and bulky... Looks very ordinary, I took the blue one...Heats up very soon...camera at low light is terrible...and only the main camera quality is decent ...the rest of the camera r just for gimmick..battery is decent...also the auto light is too dim to be visible to read.. not impressed at all with this one plus offering...main problem being the thickness and weight of the phone.."
660,Parth,A Bad phone hyped to loot you,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Stock Android, minimal bloatware.On-screen fingerprint scannerCons:Performance- performs poorer than my 3 years old OnePlus 5.Lag in using apps - doesn't feel like more than a 12-15k phone.Camera - pic quality is that of a 12k device.A waste of money mid range phone."
661,Harsha,Don't buy it...,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after 1 month of usage,the phone which spoiled one+ brand ... Lot of things disappointed me..1. Battery not lasting for 12 hours on normal basic usage(no games, no video streaming,no hotspot usage)2.Camera quality poor photos looks like 8mp camera3. Finger print reader response very low4. Phone heating issues5.poor ram managementPros:1.Design & look2.Display quality3. Pure android feel"
662,Nahush,Good midranger phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone almost for one month now....I have one major issue...that is the image processing....it takes a while after the image is captured...if you capture and immediately move your hand, the image will be blurred...I hope one plus listens to this major drawback of this phone....otherwise it's a good midranger phone....the battery life is pretty good ... fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't identify fingerprint.... camera quality is not as great as the brand has promised but it's still good not bad actually"
663,Daulat Singh,Very happy after bought this phone😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Definately your are very happy after you bought one plus nord like phone because it will provided all features in 30k which will not provided when we are compare to others phone. I am thankful to Amazon also because of rapidly delivery system.Camera is very good in focusing nd taking very clear photos. If you  are work in office then you didn't need to carry charger with you because of its battery life. Thank you team one plus nord and Amazon ❤️
664,Varun Sehgal,Go for it.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Game changer in the segment and pricing. The Plastic finish could have been improved. The Functionality, Camera and Refresh speed is what you seek at this price band. I would say go for this one if you frequently love to change phones every year and a half , top up and buy another and continue this trend rather being burdened with a 50K phone and get bore and still get stuck for resale. Live in present , evolve with changing times."
665,harshini,Really good at a great price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A really great phone for the price.90Hz screen is awesome and so snappy. The cameras are good too. Except the macro one. But I knew what I was getting into so can't complain.Battery life is great too. Lasts me a day to a day n a half at times, the charging is superfast.Really appreciate OnePlus sending a cover in the box too.The only thing missing really is the headphone jack. But I'm using the c-type converter cable and it works just fine. Will recommend using the original converter by OnePlus though."
666,shubhan ullah khan,Please check below,3.0 out of 5 stars,  All over its a good package but it's not the best out there in the market1) if you are a gamer especially if you play pubg then please don't buy it now as oneplus has confirmed that they will roll out an ota update for the frame rate setting first let it come and check the review and but itCarema is decentBattery is a major issue it's drains like anything even when you're not using the phone so please keep in mind.**However the overall the experience is damn good phone is pretty smooth RAM management is pretty osum.***All to all of you are lite user then close your eyes and go for it :)
667,Gayatri Virmani ,Does not live upto the hype,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Does not detect my fingerprint. Have to try at least 5 times. The camera quality is okay. Not excellent. I've been using it for a week now and my new Nord hangs at times. The screen goes bonkers. For a new phone the battery life also isn't upto the mark. It drains pretty quickly and I have to charge at least twice a day.I was really looking forward to this phone. Waited 2 months to get mine. But somehow the phone does not live up to the hype.
668,RK,Substandard Quality Product,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I personally feel that company's decision to lower the price(which is actually not so lower) with reduced quality rather substandard quality is not a worthy decision. और अभी तो oneplus 10000 की सेग्मेंट मे भी आना चाह रहा है तब ना जाने क्या हाल होगा? It's Front camera is pathetic and main camera having four camera. Out of which 2 really not required. इस फोन को हाथ मे लेकर प्रीमियम feel नहीं आ रहीं है. 28000 rupees कहीं से भी मिड रेंज नहीं कहलाती. इसका actual दाम 20000 से नीचे होना चाहिए दोस्तों.
669,vishakh g s,A Good allrounder....,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nord comes with1. Clean OS , 90 hz refresh  with amoled display2. Nice haptics3. Decent Camera and Battery4. Features like alert slider and in display finger print scanner.5. SD 765G chipset is fast enough for gaming.Quality of videos from this device is outstanding and also the good sound capturing.Areas to improve is:Images quality is not upto mark . 2 MP macro cam is useless. Even if there is a depth sensor , edge detection are not upto mark whrn shoot in potrait mode.No headphone jack , slight pinkish tint developed in display sometimes. And there is no always on display ."
670,mayank sharma,Good phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  My first impressionFor a start its a very handy phone, feels good in the hands not heavy and the functionality is worth the hype.I was looking for something low key and I found this device to be very apt for the purpose. Camera is good, processing is good,  sound is good.It's a overall good phone.Will be absolutely certain post a week's time."
671,Jitendra D,Camara is worst . Terrible experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not worth the money.  Especially if you are looking for a good camera. This is the worst choice.I am not a techie but as a user this phone was a big disappointment . The camera is the biggest problem.  The photos have no sharpness.No matter how firmly you hold the device (conciously) majority of the pictures are blurredIt takes few seconds atleast for the focus to be ready for the click.The portrait mode is the most terrifying experience. The background blurring result is extremely poor , Even Mi & vivo does the brilliant job .Pls don't buy if you are looking for a good camera ."
672,Prakhar,Decent buy,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Decent phone for this price. Should have taken the 7T instead for 8k more.
673,Aadil ahmad,Hype ka naajiyz fayda,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  No doubt display is very nice, but minimum brightness has been locked may due to tinting issue. It creates issues due in the night specially when u watch movies etc. speaker is good not best. Camera is worst. I think poco f1 was shooting better pics than NORD. Focus issue is also there. Front camera is nice but edge detection and boundaries need to be corrected.Battery is also draining too fastly that tooo by minimal use. Not worth this price. Its 8/128 should have been at 24000 only."
674,Rakesh,"Overall it's ok, 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall it's ok, 4/5.Some display green and pink tint issue is there still after update which can be noticed. I contacted Oneplus customer care number and they are saying it's not at all a issue, it will be cleared in further updates. Hope it will be cleared soon. Camera is decent good outputs. Battery is the key screen on time in 90Hz approx. 7hrs on a medium usage. Normal user can get it 1.1/2 day easily.For the price range and brand value it's value for money looks premium."
675,SUJAY KUMAR S,Good,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome product! I like it. But the battery backup is just ok not excellent. What I don't like is that the selfie cam could be better..not upto the expectations. And also the inbuilt AppLock is poor...offers less security.. we are not able to put lock for settings
676,Gouranga mandal,Camera rectification required,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  What i wanted, sAmoled display, a 5g facility as we going to use this phone at least for 2years, and the last one but not the least is CAMERA, very dissapointing that at first 1+ giving ad that nord is flagship camera phone, honestly a 10k budget phone give better pic than nord. Oneplus need to correct this. And i believe that oneplus will find some way to rectify this. As a software developer 1+ provide better experience for their customers."

678,Amazon Customer,Poor quality phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Miserable experience with one plus nord. Failed miserably on drop test. My son dropped it by mistake on floor...

679,Amazon Customer,Good hands feel Mobile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Earbuds/phone enroll during launch for purchasing Nord in aug20 they will receive coupon for purchasing earbuds/phone, but i haven't received the same,One thing the sim tray ejection and microphone hole both looking same it is big problem, we initially checked in micro phone for sim tray ejection,Hand feel is very nice, camera battery not checked fully"

681,Pragya thakur,Nice phone with good specs.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is pretty good at this price. You can definitely go for it.Front camera works very well as compare to rear camera. Rear camera needs to be improved by the updates. Performance is very fine as expected and 90hz display enhance your experience. Battery backup is fine as it goes for one day with single charge with heavy usage and it charges the phone in almost 1.20 hours.Experience on oxygen OS is damn good. And in hand feel of the phone is great as It's not that big and bulky.But there is a display tint issue and it is visible only in the dark but it will not affect you in any way. So just go for it.
682,Disha Dahake,A beast of midrange,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I think it was worth the 30k. Totally loved it. After reading some reviews even i got skeptical but i found no such issues of screen tint or battery drain. Camera is not bad, its still nice. If you are swithing from mid range devices you will totally fall in love with this phone else all iphone and oneplus 8 users would find it less premium whoch is obivious"
683,Pankaj,Below 25 k recommend to buy.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used this device last around 20 days. I used this phone in the night continuously 4-5 days. After using this itching started in my eyes. I immediately stoped to use this. My eyes are ok now. But I am using Samsung since long, Never feel such bad thing in my eyes. Presently using Nord and Samsung both. Weight and Speed of the phone is good."
684,Pooja Chavan,Awesome Phone bynone plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Awesome phone. Phone delivery was much more earlier than expected date. Phone packaging was good. Includes Red club membership and welcome letter by one plus. Camera quality and audio is very good. Value for money. Recommended in this price range and best launch by One Plus. The only thing which could be better is battery. It gets low soon if you use your phone continuosly..
685,Ashish Barmase,Don't buy if you use starmaker/smule or similar karaoke apps,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this for my mother and she uses starmaker and similar karaoke apps. infact that apps are her lifeline, this phone does not have 3.5 mm, so I bought Type-C to 3.5mm conveter ORIGINAL oneplus.. but alas there is audio delay issues in recording and hear-back voice on all of such apps. Want to buy directly type-C headphoses but currently none available in online and offline market, visited chroma etc. but not avaialbe not even on oneplus website. what is the point if they are not keeping compatible accessory with the phone. cheaters."
686,Aditi Shelake,Totally worth it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This phone is terrific! For those who can't afford expensive oneplus 7 or 8, this phone comes for rescue. Overall, it's a best deal at this price for a brand like oneplus. I have used it just for 3 days now and really happy with it. Will update my review after few months of use."
687,Venky,Awesomeness 😎,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  We have lot of video's and reviews about the phone being good/bad, I went a head and bought the mobile because I loved it. To be very honest the phone is good, the build quality, battery life, vivid colours, everything is good. If you ask me just buy stuff that you like and go for it ☺️"
688,Jenish H.,Nord is an emotion!😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  So here with the Nord in hand! Powerful machine I have ever used! The fluidity in the usage is God! Love the interface and the free bloatware Android usage. Oxygen os does improve the performance of the chipset!I don't know why everyone complain about the camera which is not that bad. Actually speaking, the best camera I would say and the pictures speak!Cons:1. Fingerprint reader is not that accurate. Sometimes it's really annoying in unlocking the phone. Please fix this with the upcoming updates.I find this as an only con for me!"
689,Patricks ,"Bluetooth issue(not solved by updates),Fast battery drain,Charging speed slow,Camera Quality is bad",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus gave Bluetooth connectivity issue in gift to customers buying Nord phone, Even after update bluetooth problem is not solved ,it's very annoying that phone doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and when u use bluetooth headset ,ur headset will disconnect in between of use and will not connect and even my bluetooth headset is One plus Wireless Z Bluetooth bullets.ALSO, battery drains very fast and charging is not as fast as it is claimed , Camera Quality is very bad ,One plus is loosing it's good customer because of Issues in their phones now.figer print reader is ok and camera is ok ok."
690,Akash Kumar,Thank you oneplus ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using iphone for many years , recently oneplus has impressed me with its products. This is one such oneplus mobile you will fall in love with , an absolutely stunning mobile. Mobile looks premium in your hand , glass back finish is excellent.

693,DR.,Value for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Packaging very good. Delivery very fast. After using 5 days, following pros and cons have been experienced by me.Pros-. Display, Unique Plastic cover in the box, Red cable card, Doesn't seems plastic body on back, Camera at par with the competition brands,Cons-. Battery drainage very fast and charging time as claimed by the company, 5G option will be updated in future system update. Limited camera filter options, front camera not as expected."
694,Bishnupada Ghosh,Display & Camera,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's amazing & disheartening that One Plus Nord is unworthy of its price. Pictures taken with the phone shows green tint. The icons are more or less yellow in color. Red colored Icons are deep brown. When keyboards are used the Emojies are yellow in color. Find no ways to correct these problems. You should have the option of return. It""s really wastage of money for a retired person of 74 years old."
695,Alan Alexander,Quality product with an affordable price,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Much awaited smart phone from One Plus. The high end version just compensates all the requirement of a smartphone guy.The performance & screen size is commendable.Only one to improve is the camera quality which was expected to match it's flagship models.
696,Rajat Gupta,Buy 7t instead,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Buy 7t instead. Better camera, better processor, better build quality.Dual front punchhole on Nord does not look good. Cameras ( both front and back) are average. Oxygen OS is good. Connectivity, call quality, mono speaker also good.Overall value for money."
697,Khageswar Achary,Oneplus nord,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice product but overpriced OnePlus nord
698,Rishi Koushik,Good phone but facing the tint issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone has good battery life, good camera, really fast charging, smooth 90Hz amoled display. This would have been a 5 star review from me, but the device I own has the purple tint issue at sub 20 brightness on gray backgrounds. It doesn't affect my everyday usage much but it does get irritating to see some times."
699,ashish prasanna,Lives to expectations,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Lives upto expectations. Good quality. Fairly average on everything else. I'm stuck to OnePlus because i love the OS. The best stock Android mod
700,Abilash,Awesome 👍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well ,all i need is a bloat free os and great camera and OnePlus got my back .Of course there's green purple tint issue under 20 brightness only on grey background. Recent Amoled screen panels have the same problem even on brands like rog, samsung, Huawei. hope oneplus fixes it on upcoming updates."
701,Som,Not satisfied this phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  My phone is not working may be there is a defective piece send by Amazon many problems are there like restart many times nd pdf file not open phone says not supported files nd there is no return option there is only replace option so plz think before buy this product
702,Devraj,Go For It,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pretty much nice phone honestly.I mean i was in doubt whether to buy it after reading the negative reviews but i finally did and i donot regret about this.Some people were saying about the camera is very bad but its pretty good actually.The fingerprint reader is smooth and Oxygen OS is swift like butter and battery life is good.The phone gets charged very very fast due to 30w warl charger.It works smoothly and doesnot hang for a bit even after running too much applications.No heating issue till nowOverall a good phone.
703,viswanatha reddy,I Really loved this product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really awesome product, it charges 60% within 20mins,Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)Display quality also superb. Touch sensors verg accurate and speed. Nice product from OnePlus, thank you one plus."
704,Amazon Customer,Decent phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  My first one plus phone. I dislike Chinese phones for the bloat ware that comes with phone. But oxygen OS is just like stock Android. Mobile feels good in hand. Back cover is sturdy enough to continue with it without buying a spare immediately. Screen guard provided with phone is very thin. One plus says it is to keep the on-screen fingerprint better sensitive.I am not a big fan of camera. I use it for general purpose. Camera is decent for normal use.No tint issue as told by many sites. Atleast to me.Happy with purchase.
705,Utsav Aggarwal,Just go for it ❤️,5.0 out of 5 stars,"   I was so happy when I received it. Idk why there are so many negative reviews because of them I was so double minded but the product is perfect. If you're thinking to buy just go for it. It's way faster than the mobiles in this range and it can easily beat some mobiles a little higher than the nord. Everything's great and I'm happy with it. I was also unsure of the color but when I got it, I knew it was the perfect choice. I used for a whole day and the battery backup is also good it can easily last from morning to night. Oneplus really did a good job"
706,Gaurav Porwal,Nice Product,4.0 out of 5 stars,  I really liked this product a lot. but there are some cons like the front camera is not that good and also the macro doesn't click good pictures.I have to say this Amazon Customer Service is not that good. I constantly tried to get my product delivered on time but they refused to provide any reason until i posted order details on Twitter.
707,Rahim Raza,Disappointed fingerprint reader...It takes time and sometimes doesn't work at all.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall a good experience with the mobile using since 1 month... Very much happy with the ram management for 12 GB of this device.Camera and battery has been much optimized after some regular updates... Yet I'm not totally satisfied with its fingerprint reader , although its face recognition system during screen lock meets a much better preference than fingerprint service."
708,siddharth trivedI,Not recommended to buy.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Bad product from oneplus...never expected to get such bad quality in this range. The battery quality was not at all good. The heating issue is there in the device. Smoothness was not in the phone while using. What they advertise and what the customer receive is par different.
709,Shourya Kumar,Why u should buy it,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This phone is gking thrlugh a lot of controversy but consider some things1)this is a newly launched and it will get many updates over time2)You get the feeling of the heavenly oxygen os in just 28k3)sure battery is a lil unoptimized but it will get optimized over time with updates3)Most important camera eill be updated as the people sitting at one plus are super comfy in their os and will fix it asap4)It's just 28k
710,No-one,CAUTION: Think before buy & Test throughly after buy !,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have already ordered a replacement after speaking with the Amazon customer executive for almost 2 Hours.OnePlus QA is poor. Display doesn't provide pure white. The replacement phone too has Black Crush issue.Recently Bluetooth pairing issue too is observed.Better check before buy or buy it in a outlet Experience store.Mayans S1E4 on Disney+Hotstar to check Black crush issue.
711,Amazon Customer,"worth for 30,000 rs.(i bought 12gb/256 ) variant.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  MY HONEST REVIEW:everybody knows about the advantages,let me say the disadvantages1. it carries fingerprint smudges very well.(from the 1st day itself)2.heating issues.(i use it continuosly for online classes-like 4-5 hours).(continuous 2hr usage we can feel the heat..but ..thats not an major issue)that's it.other than this i felt no problems(like for 1 month i have used,while writing this answer).and i am a normal user (no gaming) and i have to say onething...it has an amazing SUPER CHARGER....man that's really incredible fast.FINALLY : worth for the price."
712,shahidjaha,Waste of money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery discharged so quickly, even though if u charge the mobile for 100 percentage it wil drained within the 2-3 hours(use instagram and the whatsapp only)So the same coast I go for real me which is far better than OnePlus nord don't go for itWaste of money battery quality not up the mark"
713,Amazon Customer,I have a defected phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I've been using this phone for over 3 days and I find it extremely slow . I thought speed was one of the selling points for nord. After using it for gaming I can see a very visible lag while scrolling or moving from one screen to the other . The video quality isn't great either YouTube videos look blurry no good detailing whatsoever.The camera is not great at all .macro mode is a gimmick. I don't know if I have a defected phone or is it the same problem with other phones as well. Highly disappointed for a much awaited phone
714,SUBHAM GHOSH,Loved it except the battery life,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life should be improved.Other wise it's a great value for money & a perfect device for day to day uses.
715,samuel,"Simple and boring, they don't have anything of there own everything is taken from Google",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am first time using OnePlus product OnePlus Nord, honestly it is not much impressive everything it has is stock Google  things, you will not enjoy the oxygen OS, I would say samsung and Mi is more better in experience OnePlus everything thing is very simple on OnePlus..it has only the brand name that's it, you will get bored using it, think before buy or experience it somewhere else in store go for Samsung or Mi , OnePlus is less in features very simple & boring.they don't have anything of there own everything is taken from Google. OnePlus is good for its design and built that's it."
716,jahir,One plus Nord Something missing and issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Google play AR services not compatible and IR not supported this device idon't know if it is possible to OnePlus updates, cemara quality 48 mp not available zoom option available only 12 mp, photos clarity some place blurring night time blurring photo,when we have transferred vivo to OnePlus Nord upto 5 gp data bulk of files using inshare application heating issue occurred in one plus Nord but not heating vivo 1601.otherwise okAnd one more thing for AR issue resolved by another app full fill Arloopa that very useful for childrens. Heating issue occurred when charging and bulk file transfer."
717,Sareen Shah,OnePlus experience at a cheaper price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros -1. Excellent AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate. (Ignore the tinting issue hype as it does not cause any problems in day-to-day usage)2. Smooth Oxygen OS experience - No ads and extremely fast!3. Fast charging and decent battery life4. Good build quality (Though it is plastic frame, it is quite sturdy)Cons -1. Processor could have been a better one (Though 765G not at all a bad one)2. Pricing could have been a bit less.Overall, its a nice phone!"
718,ashish mohan khare,Not the best but good,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery drains a bit fast if u have watches paired with it or if u r using it as a HOTSPOT,camera quality is good,processor is smooth, fingerprint sensor is fast & accurate ...overall Not the best but good phone"
719,Paras Neupane,Awesome Nord📱,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  While unboxing camera quality and battery life was not upto the mark, but after upgrades the camera quality and battery life is awesome. The phone is fully charged in around one hour, also for charging 10-15mins you can use your phone whole day with optimum use.Only thing you miss in this product is 3.5mm Jack, if anyone face issue in Jio Network i.e. because of call over wifi setting enabled, you just need to switch the setting to call over mobile network in Calling preference menu.Thanks OnePlus for the awesome product."
720,Vishal Chauhan,Camera Quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,  The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors.The colours are crisp without any unwanted over saturation and the images come with a good amount of detail. But the experience of the camera depends a lot on the overall lighting and the lens you are using.
721,Nikhila kr,Value for money,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life and charging is really good that too for a 90hz screen. Display is the best and I don't have a green tint issue. The phone is really smooth and OS is very clean. Camera is not as flagship level and it was honestly terrible at the beginning. But it has improved since the special update Nord received. I installed Gcam and it is amazing much better than stock. Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price and little bit of future proof as 5G is coming.
722,pulkit,Summary of oneplus nord,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Guys battery quality is worst, it drains so fast and mobile heats very fast.Camera is average its not very good as oneplus gives in other mobiles.Built quality is also not very good as oneplus 7t.It is better to invest 7000 more and buy oneplus 7t that also I have and its the best phone in the range"
723,Amazon Customer,Useless product One plus Nord,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Useless product by this Co. who always gave a better product. Features are lower even than two year old model ""One plus 6"", pathetic offer by the Co.Due to some reason, could start using the phone only two days before, return window is closed, but, heavily regret my decision to have opted for this model.All future purchases shifting to Samsung / Apple. Never to suggest anyone for ""One plus"".Why do you have to offer a low grade model when you raise the bar already. Extremely disappointed by this purchase."
724,Rahul Gupta,Good buy with compromise on camera quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is awesome at this range.Mobile charging time, battery backup, finger print reader like feature is very satisfying. Phone works with very good speed while using any app or browsing data.One thing painful is it's Picture quality taken from camera. It's start getting blurred even with small zoom. So, you should not buy this mobile if you are crazy to click photos on every occasion through mobile.Otherwise it's a good buy at this range."
725,Devika❤,Boooom!! Good Buy!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,  For me the phone is pretty good.Actually most of us are not the pro players and not the photo creators for a national or international wide competitions.So the phone is more than enough for all the normal users like me and sufficient features and it gives the best of all. The processing speed is too fast and having 12 GB and 256 GB is abundant for whoever are planning to buy a new phone just because ur old phone is not working much.And Yeah the charging is too fast.For This prize I found it as price worthy and no need to change the phone for the next 3 years and even more!!
726,Sridhara Visali,Perfect,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect buttery smooth oxygen OS,camera quality is good ,runs as fast as other flagship OnePlus devices but not in gaming .Gaming works pretty well and don't expect flagship level gaming at this price point in OnePlus brand.No phone meets every expectation of user .This phone is good for regular user.The battery lasts for 1day while heavy use and one and half day for normal user. The warp charge is excellent. I didn't observed any tint issue in display I think this display issue is not seen in recent bought devices .My display is sharp ."
727,Sidharth,Just amazing ⚡,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Awesome phone. Battery life and camera quality are very good. Initially I was confused whether to buy realmex2 pro (sd855+) because of its processor. But I went for Nord and now I am sure that I made the right choice. Nord, being a new phone will get android updates for a couple of years and the sd765g is a very powerful processor. I had no issues with gaming and the gaming experience was wonderful. Plus, the oxygen os is just bliss. Undoubtedly, Nord is the best phone in this price range in my opinion."
728,Dream_catcher,Value of money,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  5 out of 4.7...🙌.. Worthy. to buy. Performance also good , video streaming quality good but only issue when I watch movies the front camera module irritating otherwise good.. overall good and decent value for money. And 3 problem I face and commoon ;- 1 is headphone jack missing and frame made plastic and not stereo speakers missing.. overall good.. OS, wrap charging fast 30 mint.;- 70% . charging ,, when full charge on screen time 4 to 5 hours continues. Gaming also good .. overall good experience .."
729,saurav suman,Best device to have in this price range.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Absolute beast with some minor UI bugs.Although display have some green tint issue with 90hz mode not with 60hz.Also day to day usage is very fluid .You don't get this type of user experience with any other device in this price range.Camera is decent not like flagship as they hyped it.Battery backup is also decent with almost 7hrs SOT.Overall if you are a gamer don't go for this go for OnePlus 8 or something like 800series processor devices.As i am not a gamer..i am utmost satisfied with this product.Using from 8 days .
730,Shivani Sharma,Satisfied with this Nord bundle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using it for over 20 days, I would like to point out one big dislike - the screen near fingerprint reader has noticeable tints. You can notice it while watching videos, playing games. Secondly, camera quality in low light is not so good, but in good lighting, you can see the images are pretty good. You can see the red color varieties and its distinction. Battery life, video and gaming experience is worth it for a phone at this cost price. If you want a durable mobile, go for it without a doubt."
731,Sharanamma Palled,U get more than wat u pay for,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great phone in the price segment , u will get more than wat u paid for .I have attached few images clicked in12mpMacro48mpFor me image quality is above average and satisfied with colours and contrast.Screen is amazingly smoothBattery is good , for a moderate users u will be left with 15-20% by the end of the day, that means u are good to go .Speakers are satisfactory , they are loud and better.No colour tint I experienced in my phone.Charges as expected . Warp charging is a bliss."
732,Monikuntal Phukan,"Nothing great, a 15k phone will provide same performance",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  While it has high RAM and storage, but the internal processor is not powerful enough to support the same. Camera quality is also very basic. Better to spend few additional thousands and opt. for galxy series with much better performance in all department.."
733,Nikhil,Worst product ever.....after sale service is also too bad no review for my complaint till now,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Dont know why they have launched such bad phone when they are not able to resolve any query of customers totally unsatisfied with this phoneWorst product ever i have ever purchased from amazon..... facing problem since i have purchased the phone and no customer service is responsing to my issue..... Guys you should not waste your money on this worst phone totally useless and second I have never seen such bad after sale service of any company.....you should think twice before buying this phone.....thats all my review for OnePlus
734,vineet,Review after 1 month usage.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  When I switched from 10k to 28k .I was bit nervous weither it will be appropriate to invest on such device but according to me 28k is bit high price 25k is perfect for this varient .Pros.1.good battery backup2.look like a premium phone3.display is excellent4.speaker is loud5.day light photo is perfect6.oxygen os is goodCons.1.low light camera struggle.2.dont have seperate password for app lock.3.According to me little bit expensive.
735,arvind k.,Phone is defective and very thin line is seen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  On Phone screen from 15 day i purchase i started noticing and thin line, which is seen on white back ground and after 1 month I started searching for service center 2 listed in website but only one is working  and when i showed them they told they want to replace the screen and i asked for replace but they denied. it was a defective peace only. but this service people not agreeingPhone is not worthy of what is paid, not at all happy with phone performance and service center"
736,Raji Thanik,Disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm writing this review after using this one plus nord (12gb,256 varient) for a week. I'm new user to one plus series ,So was much excited to buy this mobile. Now I'm so much disappointed battery life of the mobile is so worst, I need to charge my mobile every 6 hours even with low usage, camera quality is not even like redmi. SIM is not working properly, everytime it's coming as switched off. Other than classy look everything else is disappointed"
737,Raghu,Pathetic Camera by OnePlus Standards !,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera is no where close to OnePlus 6T which is two year old phone. On spec comparison everything seems better. But practically the phone is really bad. I purchase Nord 5G 256GB +12GB RAM model and sold to cashify for 22k. 8k loss for usage of a day. A Big No to this Phone. Dont buy.
738,Sai v.,Great at this price with OxygenOs being one of the best,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:1.Inscreen fingerprint works perfectly2. Colors are good and display is great3. Oxygen OS is very easy to use & got almost everything you need4.front camera is good in normal light conditions and ultra wide view is useful5.looks good at this price6. Warp charging works wellCons:1. Photos taken in low light are not impressive2. OnePlus says phone will brighten screen in dark for face unlock but sometimes doesn't work properly like works 6-7/10 times3. Audio from phones speakers is average.
739,Amazon Customer,Bit of over do with cameras,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Straight to the point:- Camera is awful. Pixels distort and too much of beautification/filters applied. Consider macro lens does not exist because it is useless.- Battery is life just average like any other mid range phones.- Overall build quality and performance is smooth for 30 bucks price range.
740,ranjeet singh,Battery backup is very poor,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery is draining faster even with low or moderate usage.Battery backup is very poor. Even I have not installed any games yet. Only instagram, Facebook and songs like normal daily work. Then also it is draining too fast. Only 4_5 hours of screen on time with normal routine work. Highly disappointed."
741,Yusuf Kulkarni ,Good product at this range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this phone for about a month...This is really a good phone in mid range for avg use . The software is at its peak with oxygen OS performing great .  Coming to its battery performance = it is quite good , one can use it for whole day ..... I won’t personally recommend this phone for the people who are obsessed with mobile photography becoz the camera quality is not that great ...it’s just okay for regular use ... 90hz refresh rate is really good ,you can feel the difference.... would say that this phone is really good at this price range ."
742,Keshav,Front camera not impressive,3.0 out of 5 stars,  As we know oneplus try to do better always but in this product oneplus left some mistakes like front camera not impressive .Front camera is so bad quality pictures .Speakers are not impressive .And very things is good as like prize .Plastic body we can adjust but camera not adjustable
743,Nilesh kumar,"Phone is good ,but battery life 50 50",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi viewers,On the time pre-book , I booked phone and I was curosity for Nord phone . After used one week I found some issue which aa the followingProns : if you talk about phone then I saw good and size and weight (light weight) are standard and pretty UI of android 10 .Cons : Battery life less , but it's depend upon the usage . But I observed ,if oneplus will do more work on battery life .As per my usage 100 to 15 % came in 5 hour .Over all phone is good and minimum budget onePlus gave best for users."
744,Manoj k,"Excellent camera, super build",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super bright screen , excellent camera performance both in day and night. Responsive fingerprint scanner.sturdy build quality. Battery shulould have been large atleast 5000mah. Otherwise super phone much better than other chinese phones."
745,Anjali ,The best midrange phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Writing this review after using it for 1 week. It's a awesome phone with lots of new things. Best camera both the rear and front one. Battery life is not that great. It manages to last for only one day with moderate use but not to forget about the fast charging. Overall I would say a nice phone, stylish with good camera and you can customise the display, color and many other things as just you want your phone to be.Thank you One Plus for bringing this midrange phone to the market."
746,Tilak,Product with broken screen and amaozn failed to replace.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Highly disappoint with Amazon being a prime member. Deffective product with broken screen delivered after waiting for over 21days. Even after technical engineer confirmation of product defectiness amaozn not able to replace with new phone and ask to wait for another 10days time. This is highly disappointing, request you to arrange replacment without further delay. Since i have not use the phone yet can't comment on quality."
747,MohmedMaaeez Malek,"30k phone with an average camera, average battery life",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Actually I am not a heavy user so this phone works fine for me but One Plus claimed that the battery charges from 0-70% in 30 mins which is actually false. In 30 mins it charges from 0-55%. The camera is average, takes 1-2 seconds to process after clicking the photo; if you immediately move it away after clicking the photo, then the photo gets blurred. Battery life is normal, it lasts for more than a day on normal usage.Buy it if you want a OnePlus experience."
748,komal,Not worth it,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I brought new one plus nord on 2nd if September.It getting hanged sometime.There is always bluetooth connectivity problem it get disconnected automatically.Screen is going blank sometimes when I switched between application.Sound keeps playing for 5-6 second if I switch from youtube to another application.And there is network problem I have to restart the phone 3-4 times a day as it showed my phone out of coverage area or switched off .
749,Haresh,Phone misses basic functionality,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Oneplus as a brand i purchased the Oneplus Nord. But i would suggest Honor i.e huwai phone and software is excellent. Oneplus Nord missing basic functionality like whenever i call there is an mute button on phone which gets pressed in every call multiple times. I think oneplus team has missed to give focus on the basic calling functionality. There is no option to remove mute button. Further phone doesn't have basic copy feature like u can't copy selected text from sms you want. Entire message gets copied.Only Look wise and other features are good.
750,Swapnil,OnePlus Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros-Ease operationGood cameraSlim designValue for moneyGet less warmCons-Battery life is just ok, you need to charge it 2 times approx in a day without using battery saver.That's why stopping for battery at 3 stars, otherwise would given 5."
751,Libin,#Best Product From The Best Brand# but the tyndall issue is there,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  All round it is a best phone for normal people.It is an amazing product."" But there is a display issues(tyndall issue)"",no camera issue, but the battery draining is little more ! But we can believe that the oneplus software updates will be fix it soon. The fingerprint sensor is so fast and smooth. Lightweight is an important factor. It is much better when it comes with aluminium frame and Snapdragon 845 G processor.I feel better with this phone because I waited for a long time to get a better product. #Comparatively 1+  Nord is a best choice compare with realme X3# *(just my opinion)*"
752,Vinoth,Wothy Buy from Oneplus Brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Good overall performance phone.PROS:1.Display was awesome2.Good Daylight camera performance.3.Good battery backup with 30W dart charger4.90HZ display was smooth5.Gaming was smooth while playing in 90HZ mode.6.Got 3 updates within a week.(FutureProof phone)7.OXYGEN OS for smooth experience.CONS:1.Camera was average during lowlight2.No Headphone jack3.No Sterero speakersOverall - Good all rounder phone under 27K.Buy this phone without any second thought.
753,Nishant Sharan Roy,An all rounder with sub-par battery performance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  An all rounder however the only observable kink till this point is the battery performance. It's adequate for most of the daily use scenarios, except heavy gaming.Also, if you're looking to use the mobile cameras extensively, then install GCam rather than using the in-built camera app, because the difference is noticeable."
754,Md Musharraf Khan,OnePlus Nord Review after a Month,4.0 out of 5 stars,  1. Fingerprint is very fast and accurate.2. Battery life is above average.3. Camera quality varies with the updates as OnePlus sends more updates.4. Display : Yes their is a tint issue but it's not noticeable until u try to notice it.5.

Little bitAt Last thing think about Oxygen OS or Realme UI you will never regret on Oxygen
760,Narender Kumar,Not worthy at a cost of 30 K,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product  but trust me  not worth 30000 lots of important is required on this product.1 screen resolution is not healthy for eyes. One cannot look continus to screen it effect eyes.2 while recording any call it's announced to both that your call is being recorded. Which should not be a familiar features3 as heard earlier. Even multiple updates Camraa quality is not at par.4 if I have worth to spend 30k or more then lost of other branch are there in India which can opet to avoid above.
761,Prabakaran,Worst experience ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst experience ever never expected these kind of quality oneplus the crack which I have posted its shocking bcoz it has dropped from a height below the knee that too with the case on this will be my last product from oneplus hats off for your quality and support guys

768,Amazon Customer,Writing after one month usage,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I am so lazy to write a review  for any of my orders in the past few years. But this phone bought with a total of 32k (along with insurance for 12GB version) fully disappointed me. Writing this after one month of usage. I had better experience with me Redmi.Repeatedly hangs outBrowser performance is the worstAudio is poorAll other functions are same as other phones. No need to buy this much of a costly phone for an avg performance like a 13k mobile.
769,Mudit Sharma,Got a defective piece,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Completely disappointed got a defective item the speaker of the phone is not working although they refund my money but got a defective piece from a brand like one plus it sucks!!
770,Eswar,Over Hyped not up to the Mark...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  After using more than a week i feelCameras average. 2MP micro camera is literally sucks. 5MP dept cam is for namesake.Main camera takes good shots in day-time.Battery life is very good.Fingerprint scanner is avarage.Refreshrate not smoother as expected.Processor is small upgrade of 730G dont expect like flagship performance. Decent at gaming no heating Thanks for good optimization. Final verdict this phone is over priced... better go with 730g processor Mobile with stock Android will feel same experience.

773,manikandan,unexpected camera quality and output awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The OnePlus Nord is a fantastic mid-range smartphone, and one that betters its main competition in a number of ways.From its large number of cameras to its 90Hz refresh rate, 5G, AMOLED screen, slick software and modern, mostly premium design, this phone packs in an awful lot for not very much money.It’s clear where cost taking about 28000rs modeland batter life very disappointment because when your open the camera take to high resolution video recode that the time battery life is down quickly ..."

Batery life is regularly normal since I've used for one day, I couldn't find any big drop in battery with regular use even I played pubg, used camera, watched video etc.3. I have seen many reviews mentioning the display issue, there are no display issues. I am also using dark mode with less brightness.4.

Refund post return was processed but no one is coming to pick the phone. Ordered this for my fiance who is going to US and will be without a phone because of this!!Ridiculous experience. Not expected from One Plus and surely not from Amazon. Really poor."

791,Avinash S.,High performance specs but average performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing configuration of processor,12gbram, quad camera at relatively lesser cost was a surprise, but it's not very smooth, touchscreen is very average, while gaming the touchscreen fails to recognise all the fingure moments. Camera quality is also average and so is the battery backup which requires charging more than once a day with regular usage (in next few months it will degragde)With specs had really high expectations but I think I was even good with 16k mobile as the performance is still the same."
792,Jyoti,It's not a bad deal but could have been better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  1) My only disappointment is with battery life. It last barely a day with full charge.

It gets the job done."

You have only choice to lock the phone and unlock.Kindly do something about that. And many other problems with os or something.
794,E K.,ONEPLUS NORD,5.0 out of 5 stars,  All over it's an immense package of speed with style. Fingerprint reader is quiet fast. Camera can be improved with future updates although it's very good as of now. Battery life is bareable as 30W Warp charger charges up the device really quick. The back is also glass with Gorillla Corning glass so you can use it without a back cover. I am Completely satisfied with The Oneplus Nord.
795,Nikunj,Phone is flickering on every app.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone with loads of good hopes, but it disappointed me very hugely. I am experiencing flickers while scrolling many apps like Google, slo motion videos, gallery and every apps.My expectations shattered since I came to know that I have to run 30 kms to service center for this problem.

796,Pratheek R,Best phone under 30K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the good phone under 30K cost. Happy with the Google default applications and performance. If you compare this product with any of the same cost phone, you'll end up with more positive things. But don't compare with other products having cost greater than 35K / 40K. For normal users, it'll be the best phone according to me."
797,varun,Not worth penny,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I suggestion NOT TO BUY.If your luck doesn’t favours you you face the problems mentioned below.Over rated hard ware specUnder quality software. Phone gets auto reboot , looses data. And coming to camera , there is a lag, you get the click sound but the later moment is getting captured.When using camera phone gets heated up. Called customer care about these issue, they recommend factory reset.... but in vain."

799,Prathamesh Salgar,My opinion about this phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus phone and I wanna tell OnePlus that their quote of (Never Settle) is actually true because this phone is a flagship killer phone for camera, speakers, display and the 90hz refresh rate this is a monster in the hands of professional photographers and what I disliked about it is the gaming qualityIt cannot run PUBG at 60fps and the battery life pretty good and the fingerprint reader & the face unlock is fast AF!!!!!!!!!! Thats all I wanted to say (THANK YOU ONEPLUS I LOVED THIS PHONE)"

801,Shreya Sanghvi,Definately overhyped!!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nord is definitely overhyped to the next level , but the price is good and it is not the best OnePlus device nowhere near oneplus8 camera is the weakest point the third camera for the Bokeh mode is not even used when you hide the third camera and click on portrait mode of the picture quality is still the same , if you have no problem with camera go for it , or increase your budget and go for oneplus8, overall it's  a decent phone"
802,nitin,Butter smooth performance except battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Every thing is working fine.But there is battery drain issue in my device. Planning for replacement.

813,aman siraj,Everything is great except the camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's get straight to the point everything is great except the camera that too in low-light conditions, in low light conditions it is so bad that it looks cartoonised though gcam fixes it whereas it is brilliant outdoors and just like every android it laga a little on snapchat videosOverall a good buy!"

818,Khemchand S.,After using a week camera optimization is good but can made better by GCam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using OnePlus Nord for 1 week I can say that it's worth my money. I think for it's price range it's enough RAM and internal storage.Performance is also great.Only think concerning about this phone is camera but camera optimization can be tweaked by GCam app. I have tried it myself, and astrophotography is amazing.Overall I am happy with this phone.😀"
819,Pravin Nagare,DON'T PURCHASE!!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Don't purchase it very low end device in high cost.My redmi note 8 pro was performing far better than this.In package display issue display looks pale.Pubg won't even run in high graphic and hd audio and I paid 30k for this crap device.Put some extra and go for 8 or 8 pro.Waste of money
820,Sanal Yasir,More than expected,5.0 out of 5 stars,  was little nervous while buying bcoz i have seen so many videos talking about camera quality and pointing out cons of nord but after getting this device i came to know about only one con which is speaker it is good only when volume is full otherwise u will have to struggle in hearing but overall phone is good worth spending 30k and camera is awesome i have compared it with one plus 8 pro and u can easily point out the difference that camera on one plus nord is far more better than one plus 8 pro.

824,Mohsin,Oneplus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Premium look... lightweight...(grey onyx) superb ..
825,Ankit Koshti,Value for price in mid range,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I won’t over sell this product but it is the beat mid range phone available now. Better than Samsung M and A series. I would always go for snapdragon processors than any home built processors.Looks good for the price and worth it
826,Arya chatterjee,OnePlus shuld nt do that,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Seriously OnePlus u shodnt do that to ur customers...the ph is overall good but the most worst thing I can't even bear is the camera front wala...disgusting it feels like we are going back to the 2 megapixel era with a big punchhole design...u hve gone mad bro or fooled us by creating this kind of huge hype
827,Kaushik,Awesome budget 5G ready phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pre-ordered on July 28th, and delivered on Aug 3rd l, before actual sale!!Phone is very good in terms of apps and games performance, smooth display, battery life, Oxygen OS, front camera. Back camera is not that great or at par with flagships, but still it takes pretty good photos under normal conditions, so on usual days, it will work great.Only complaint is regarding bloatwares of Facebook and Netflix apps. That could have been avoided to keep the OS as clean as possible."
828,Akanksha,Insta issues,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really don't know why this phone is not giving me a good instagram experience. I scroll through insta a lot. But in this phone, the stories are mostly blur, the theme keeps changing, and many more problems I guess I'll realise in near future. Also, the volume button takes a little time to respond, it's not instant. Plus, I wish the colour blue would have been the way they showed. A little disappointed but okay. It's a good value for money."
829,hrishikesh,A good daily driver.,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing this review after a 1.5month of usage....After 2 updates the rear camera quality has increased but for selfies i still  prefer GCAM. Speakers are loud and good. 90hz display is something else probably the best feature of this phone. Battery backup is good. I get around 7-7.5hrs for normal usage and phone gets charged in 65-70mins. I haven't Noticed any lags whatsoever. Oxygen OS nails the software experience. In hand feel is premium.Overall all a very good daily driver.
830,shashank agarwal,Ok. But not so good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Phone is pretty good. The Marble Blue colour is very eye catching. I'm writing this review after 15 days use. Two OTA updates are already provided for this phone. The problem with new update is that the charging is slow compared to the new one. The new one plus nord went 0 to 70 percent in just 30 mins. But now, it take 0 to 70 percent in 50 mins. Remaining all things are at there best. FP sensor is very fast. The phone has never hung. The phone never got heated. Front camera is also good."
831,Saranpreet,Superb Phone for today and the future,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Review after 1 week of usage ....Excellent phone with awsome camera ...No bloatware ....

Really happy with my NordJust go for it ..
832,Kalyani Charpe,Smart mid range phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice phone for the users who have medium to high usage. Would not recommend for the user who is expecting too much out of it. I would give 4.5 rating. -0.5 is because of camera quality onlywhich company mentioned to be of flagship i.e OnePlus 8 (which is not obviously). Other stuff are just perfectly fine.
833,Pankaj Meena,ABNORMAL TEMPERATURE RISING AND BLACK BAR IN LOW BRIGHTNESS,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My OnePlus NORD heated abnormally sometime if just Youtube is playing it starts heating. Contacted amazon customer, they did diagnosis and found device temperature is more than 48degree(48.6).More than 45 degree temp may affect CPU, i got green tinted device. Although i got refund for this as replacement was not available. May be it is heating because of green tinted display(I DON'T KNOW).THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING NORD"
834,Amit Kumar Gupta,This is not a premium phone .

836,Krishna Reddy Mandala,Thought good to go but not...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good but no connectivity to ear phones and it over reacted in capturing photos in various weather conditions that made me surprised swtuching from iOS but end of the day you get for what you pay. iOS is my best experience so far with security features and simplification! Go for Nord from budget perspective.

843,Prasad,Camera and dark mode flicker issues,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera for both videos and pictures comes really bad, at this price you should get atleast an average cemera quality phone. I was really really disappointed in it. Also in dark theme mode the screen flickers and that too a phone that has been just 2weeks old. overall I would give just 1star."
844,Ashwini,Nord pre booking,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had purchased OnePlus nord in pre booking from Amazon which had started from 28th july. All the features of the phone are very impressive, but the company should have given 1 ear phone with nord."

846,Rajan M,The Best Budget Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I am reviewing after 10days of use . The phone's speed and refresh rate is mind blowing . The charging is really fast . And the 256gb storage is really best at this budget price . Camera is also cool. We don't need a SD card too . They give a 50gb free cloud storage and The sound quality is also good . Finally The most liked thing is the packing .
847,Sunny,Waste of money: Battery and Camera Issue,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst product, seems like 10,000 Rs product. Waste of money, as battery life is worst. It got charged fast as well as drain super fast. If it's 100% charged, it reduces to 10-20% battery level within 5-6 hours without heavy use (no game, video watching). Camera quality is also average. So this is not expected from such costly product. Only good thing is touch screen. But Camera and Battery are critical things."
848,Ruhul,A big disappointment,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There isn't any notification light. either to show the charging status or to notify calls, messages etc.Camera quality not as expected.The biggest problem with mine nord is the Hanging issue. Despite having 8GB RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, 2.4 GHz octa-core processor, It got hung while playing Carrom pool and while using Myntra. Haven't even installed any big application or any games of high graphics or storage."

I hated Android for it's bloatware but thanks OnePlus has taken care of it. Only thing I'm missing is iPhone retina display, that is no match anywhere."
851,Suhail Shaikh,Brilliant Phone at reasonable price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The cheapest phone in the 5g category. I see people commenting on issues with camera but they should understand that we are purchasing a mobile phone and not a DSLR camera. We should be looking into the voice quality, maybe video clarity and the speed of the processor. The mentioned features are absolutely fine of Nord. I had a given a star less because there is always a scope for improvement on all the aspects."
852,Sean f.,Not as good as OnePlus 6 and good for the price.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used to own OnePlus 6 and it's much better than OnePlus nord in every way. It's got headphone jack, it's camera is better, it's wider. It's thinner comparing with nord.Cons: front camera is placed in wrong position so pics are not good at all. It's thicker. It's litte bit slower than OnePlus 6. I"
853,SANNJAY S JOSHI,My first OnePlus product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a very nice smartphone. Camera quality is great, gives crisp and lovely pictures. Better than any other phone I have used till date. Battery charging is just unbelievable. Charges at around 11% every 5 minutes. 100% done in just over 45-50 minutes. Though till date, I have never charged beyond 95%. Do occasionally peek into the OnePlus community to see how others are doing. I am sure no one is unhappy with this product. I am certainly not !!!!"
854,Yogesh kale 8319540846,Awesome phone😍😍,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very light, easy to handle, cameras are good I kind of like the ultra wide selfie it's really wide! Ambient display plays a very important role. Fast (since I was using mi A1 before). Excellent performance, quick charge saves a lot of your time. I would have liked it with headphone jack but nevertheless we can use adapters. The headphone equaliser is pretty good. Rest just buy and use it😉"
855,Pankaj Kothari,Camera is not good. this not a one plus 8 camera.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The camera optimization is not good. When I was clicking the pictures from camera. There was some nice shots.

856,Amazon Customer,A really great midrange product 💯💯,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is great and got 3 system updates. After that the phone is working really good and camera is really good(it's not as bad as people criticized). I have personally taken a lot of photographs in nightscape, Pro mode and the normal mode the pictures are really very awesome.

857,Dheeraj s.,Front camera is not as expected. If you zoom the picture you won't find that quality.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had very hight expectation with the Camera, more specifically with the front. As we use it more for selfies. But that has disappointed me more. The quality, selfies in low light are pathetic. Don't buy if you are specifically looking for selfie camera. Might be possible it could be an issue with particularly with my device but untill I realise the replacement date was gone. I wish I could replace with another OnePlus Nord."

862,Amazon Customer,Great device,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is very good, infact provided almost all the necessary softwars required.Something I felt unusual is that during charging, my red cable becomes hot. I don't really know that it is a defect or it is happening with everyone.On this device, OnePlus has worked excellently and the most lovely thing about this is that it doesn't takes much time to charge. All over it is a good option but better options are available in the market in this price range."

909,Sujay,Just a phone with normal features but great OS !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The phone is a good attempt by one plus! The main camera works just fine but the macro camera is better not to be used.It's battery does a fine job but not as big as most budget phones that give us 9-10 hours of life. You can use it for atmost 6-8 hours.Price is much higher as compared to other phones with same features but Oxygen OS is a fulfilling ad free, bloatware free OS. That's the best takeaway from this phone."

922,Amazon Customer,Issue in Bluetooth Connectivity,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Big issue with Oneplus Nord is Bluetooth connectivity. Takes too long to connect bluetooth device, when connected it gets disconnect automatically. Onnplus should work more with bluetooth connectivity as the device do not have earphone jack.Camera quality is not good. Low durability due plastic/fiber frame. Not expected these qualities and issues from Oneplus.OS 10.5.7 is awesome to use."

928,Reema,Best phone in this price range,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love this phone. Everything about it is great. I am not a gamer, and if I were, I would spend more money to buy a phone which had a better chipset. With this price, this phone delivers more than other phones on the market. You have to learn how to use the various features of the camera (which provides amazing shots). Without a doubt the best phone in this price range. I don't know why people are complaing about it."

Camera is decent, macro camera should be improved, but overall camera is good.Battery is sufficient given that this phone has 30w warp charger so battery is not a issue.Overall this phone is pretty good at a pretty great price."
937,Pritha,"Great phone, require some minimal changes considering indian customers...",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Beast phone in terms of look, design, and oxygen os experience.

950,Rahul Gupta,"Terrible performance, unfit product",1.0 out of 5 stars,   I regret buying this phone.Pathetic touch screen and the screen lagging within the first 2 days was highly unprecedented. Even a phone worth 6K won't hang within first 2 days.Pissed of at Amazon too as they didn't allow the return. Amazon deliberately scheduled a late visit by their expert technician so that the product return time is lapsed.

I cant take any calls in the first go! I always need to call back and only then the call goes through!Google maps doesnt work right on the oneplus and I'm having a really difficult time using Oneplus for basic functionality! Definitely a downgrade for me moving from apple to oneplus

956,Gauthaman,Worth the wait and money....,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Been using it for 2 weeks now.... The battery is good and lasts for a day with moderate usage. There is no display tint issue as said by many users. The camera quality is however a bit low compared to other flagship models.. the colour saturation in camera is low comparatively with my OnePlus 7. But overall it's worth the money. Certain features could improve with updates like camera.

966,MERIN DEV,Network issue..poor connectivity..read before buying,4.0 out of 5 stars,  If you're buying this device keep in mind that it has some network related issues.I had no complaints regarding performance and usage for day to day and even gaming.The only major problem is slow internet speed in OnePlus Nord even though I switched sim card with other phones they were working just fine but not Nord...So my urge is not to buy this phone until OnePlus fix this issue..
967,laxman,Good but costly,4.0 out of 5 stars,  This a very good phone..... It's battery life is good after update ...... And every one knows the oxygen os it's optimization is too good with 765G chip ... It gives very good performance.... About it's camera  it's macro and depth sensors are waste but it's main camera is good and its front camera are really good ...... Overall device is a good product from one plus but slightly costly it's upper midrange phone
968,Er JM Singh,Bad exp. Held with oneplus,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not a good choice  ..Not expected from oneplusNo one came to pick up and to replace and not even for service etcJust wasted my time and money this timedon't say return window is closedJustice is due with amazone
969,deva,A successful outcome from 1+,5.0 out of 5 stars,  A standard out put from 1+ which is worth to spend 30k for 12/256gb. I ve enjoyed the features which is realistic as they promoted.  Most of the existing manufacturer are showing their features only in papers where 1+ justifying their best.
970,Roshni Rebecca,NOT A BAD CHOICE. SO FAR SO GOOD,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Pros:Good displayUser experience is always promised for OP users90Hz is amazingBattery life is goodNo display tint issuesHandy and Easy to holdCons:Average SpeakersAverage cameras at low light
971,Umakant Shukla,Good phone in this price range,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am little disappointed on battery drainage on standby mode but leave this phone performance is best in my view. I also like it back camera clearity and fast changing mode.I experienced good gaming performance, game like pubg, cod, etcLeave battery drainage problem I had not fased any issues till now.Nice phone in this mid range price but charge high price for 5g support in my point of view."
972,Nishant Redu,Best device in this range,5.0 out of 5 stars,  The best device available in this price rangeGaming is good.I played pubg at high graphics with screen recorder on and it was very smooth experience.Camera is also good.Main thing is the oxygen os.it gives the best experience in this range
973,Davinder Singh,Not even 4G working properly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm facing a strange network error in my OnePlus Nord.

974,Amazon Customer,No option for automatic call record,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  0 starZerooooooNo option for automatic call recordWe can record call manually...we have to record each n every call by pressing record button..but there is voice which says *your call has been recorded"" which can be heard by the receiver alsoPlease come up with some update to resolve this.Without automatic recording...the price value of NORD is 0"
975,Amazon Customer,Battery dries up very fast. Major issue,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery dries up very very fast. In idle condition when not using the phone and no ternet still it dries up very fast. Believe me, I never faced any issue with my previous phone Oppo F9pro like these. With this phone, if m watching/ chatting the battery dries up like a water. Rectify this or change the handset. I have changed my frequency to 60 ,still no effect.  I have attached few pics for your perusal."
976,Shashank,Amazing Phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  This is one of the best mid-range phones didn't expect anything less from oneplus.
977,Vishwa,Beautiful experience with one plus,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Its awesome. I was very worried what i might receive after reading lot of reviews.

Though I have mentioned my issue in the OnePlus forum there is no response.... disappointing because there isa no audio jack and we are dependent on bluetooth.2. Delivery by Amazon is good.
979,Amarulla.s,Products difeat,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Camera glass inside dust available
980,GAYATRI DEVI,Value for money purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars,   I don't have words for this mobile. This is the King of all under 100k mobiles.30k purchase and features chappar faad.😍😍Battery should be 5000MaH and mobile should be water resistance atleast.Finger print reader is ok.Battery life is goodCamera is quite good.
981,Prashant,Quality Compromised Primium Smartphone,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Quality has been Compromised to make it cheaper and it reflects after use within a week. Bluetooth connectivity is hanging, battery drains fast comparative to other smart phone even on 60 Hz display, network comes and goes where there is full network coverage. More to come, as this is my review after one week use."
982,worst,touch screen is very hard,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using nord for a week and i am fully dissatified with the product ....worst touch feel ...average battery. I havent felt a smooth feel while using nord.Its very hard to move my hands while playing games....overall its worst to buy for 28k bucks
983,Abhi,Pathetic,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst experience with an android phone, the most basic feature like automatic call recording is not available. Also when you start a call recording there is a voice notification at both the ends mentioning the 'call recording has started'"

Luckily Amazon accept my return request so I am Returning this product
987,Ramprakash,Excellent peroformance and visual quality,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everthing seems to be perfect with the phone. The only concern is if you keep 90hz refresh rate and play games with high visual settings, the battery seems to drain pretty quick. And since it does not have 3.5mm jack, using bluetooth headset aslo drastically reduces battery. If connected with type c to 3.5mm connector, it provides excellent battery life"
988,Amazon Customer,Don't expect too much... you will definitely be satisfied with this model for the price you paid,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery back up is approximately 13-16hrs...maximum.Camera is ok not something great not something bad.User interface is best..also 30k model is worth the money.Gaming wise works fine..neither tooo good or bad.Selfie camera is good.But in dark picture calrity is less.Overall a very satisfying phone within budget of 30k.Don't go for lesser storage 64GB. Not worth.

991,NaaG Kosanam,Top in the Worst mobile list.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   12GB + 256 GB Blue variant :1. Lag in updating the photo,which was opened from gallery option in camera.2. Too much beautification in photos those are taken using front camera( I think girls no need to do makeup for taking photos because this phone did it).3. Its better not to talk about Battery performance because its too worst."
992,Titas,Expectations hurt!! But hope for the best,4.0 out of 5 stars,"   Camera quality is not up to the level. However, the main camera is simply wow but the other cameras need further updates. Slow motion video recording is not stable at all, the background light blinks too much! Video uploaded!!

994,Alfred,Best phone for the price........,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing phone for the priceBut improvements could have been made with the macro camara which is is the worst in the phone.For,the 256GB varient the storage is enough without any expandable slots.Afterall it's one plus.........🖤"
995,Hari Nair,"Don't fall for it, 5G is Far Away......",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  My OnePlus 6 still feels & performs way better than this Nord. Not worth the price, Disappointed! Try to get a 7T, 8 or 8 Pro by stretching your budget instead. By the time our networks are 5G ready, there will be way better options available than this one."

998,Noman C.,Camera Could have been better,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The way Oneplus Nord was promoted was having all issues resolved from One plus 1 to one plus 8 and camera qualities. But actually scenario is differentPros:Edgy/sharp look and catchy colorhandyRAM and storage capacitySound qualityCons:Front camera is too grainy. After having two camera's also in front, clicked image quality would have been better."

Oneplus' quality  isn't provided in camera .Otherwise for gaming it is good but the camera is the most disappointing thing in the phone . Rear camera is good but the front camera is  really bad .

1001,Deep Rajpal,Do not get carried away with the price,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had a 1+ 6 before. I think that was better. If I had a choice to exchange this, I would do it and buy a 1+7t or a 1+8. It's heavy. No doubt the price is attractive. My phone hung 4 times while on a call. The screen quality is poor. U have to be on very high brightness to get the best colors. Battery Life is poor. They need to update a lotof software glitches. I hope they do soon."

If u have skyhigh expectation this is not the phone. Budget oneplus proves again as budget one..."
1005,Amazon Customer,Do Not Go For Nord!!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The camera is definitely not upto the mark. I am a OnePlus user from the past 6 years, but OnePlus Nord is a complete disappointment on the basis of a camera, knowing the cameras of OnePlus are too good. Plus, the battery life is not good as expected. I don't play any games on my phone, and yet the battery doesn't last long. I would definitely not recommend this phone for anyone."

1011,saurav,Everything you could ask for.,5.0 out of 5 stars,  It's everything you could ask for. It's a good daily driver. One plus is known for top service and updates and it's true. They are giving updates for camera and  software which makes the phone a mid range flagship phone.

(Very rare in buget phones)90 Hz display is awesome.Macro and depth camera is waste of money.Front camera videos are not that sharp in artificial lighting. ( 9W LED in room )Pink tint issue when using at night (acceptable, only when you are using in dark mode)"
1021,Dibya Saha,Does a pretty decent job!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Been using this phone for a week now. Pretty premium and lag free experience. The main camera is the real deal and does everything. Other cameras on the rear are pretty much useless. The front cam is decent. The oxygen os is running smooth and the display is great. One downside is the battery. I have to charge the phone multiple times a day. Maybe an update could fix this.
1022,Sushovit Rout,Amazing phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Got this legend delivered to me today on Occasion of Teacher's day. Wanted to gift my dad for his birthday this month.

1026,akshay suresh,New improved Nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I got my nord on August 26th since it was a August manufactured unit. I don't see any pink or green tinting issue when brightness is lowered and the phone comes with oxygen OS 10.5.3 out of the box and after updating it to 10.5.5 the screen on time of the phone has drastically improved. According to my preliminary usage  i can say that the Nord is definitely a top phone to consider under 30k.
1027,Wasti,OnePlus Nord is not just Smart it is Super smart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  OnePlus nord is not a flagship phone but it is not lesser then those flagship phones, its camera quality is awsome and battery is very good, fingerprint scanner works fantastically. Graphics are good while playing heavy games, which is due the its processor and OnePlus Oxygen OS. I strongly recommend this phone. This is the one that we want in our pocket."

1037,Parth Patel,Camera quality is very poor.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Speed, display, speaker, battery life is excellent. But camera quality is very poor. Nord have 6 camera set up but not perform very well. I have pixel 2 xl pixel have only one back side, one camera resolution is much batter than Nord 4 back side camera. also with selfie camera. I think company using cheap marketing tactics."

1044,hamdan patel,Awesome phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dual sim phone with speedy operation, good camera. Good battery backup with quick charge. It takes 1 hr for battery to get fully charged."
1045,ejo3132,Average camera performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Indoor camera performance is just average. Not worth this price. I sold the phone ovrr olx snd bought a poco x2. If camera is your first priority,then a BIIIIG NOOOO to NORD. Poco x2 which is almost 10k lesser than the jord gives much better pictures."
1046,Karthik,Classy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A perfect mid ranger with everything made out of oneplus  7 and 8. Better battery, 6 cameras,12 GB ram, better screen, 5G . A perfect touch of everything."
1047,Mayur,Classic Phone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,  I don't know why people are expecting so much flagship features in this price and comparing it with onplus 8 camera. Oneplus Nord is already very well performing.Camera is great.Getting 8 hours of screen on time on normal usage.Screen is extremely smoothOnly con is no 3.5mm jack.......but it's manageable..Don't think twice just go for it.....
1048,Karthikeyan,Somehow astonishing,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is absolutely an excellent phone at 30k with 12gb ram and 256gb rom. The fingerprint reader is genuine as top series as 7t,battery life is enough for one day, somehow in case of camera its is elegant and extraordinary in bright light condition but in full and low light condition it is not much as acceptable as a buyer. And at last thanks for oneplus for this astonishing phone.."
1049,Abdul,I highly recommend this device if you're not very particular in getting the best mobile photography.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  A solid device for daily usage with smooth performance by oxygen os. I like the oneplus community were you can post suggestions and issues which might get the attention of the developers for improving the device. Camera is decent, obviously not up to flagship standards. All in all an impressive device with premium feel and experience and only slightly lagging wrt camera performance."
1050,Manik,Over hyped,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Frame is plastic... haven't Expected....+ The YouTube reviews are too much over paid... nothing so great about oxygen OS and nord itself. The camera cut out sucks...it kills content. + I hate the way the upper part darkens while gameplay

1052,!,Best phone of 2020 in 30k,5.0 out of 5 stars,  Bloody good product!!One plus has finally understood that the sub 30k is the sweet spot for them. People prefer Samsung and Apple for anything that's over 40-50kI bought 3T 3+ years back and it worked like a charm. Nord is same price range and definitely a best buy in Sep 2020 for 30k
1053,Souvik,One of the best overall midsegment smartphone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well , it is what it is , a midsegment smartphone and it definitely has some setbacks like the 2 useless cameras on the back and the stereo speakers are not there which is kind of true for most of the smartphones in this range and it is like the norm for the midtier smartphone. Hence I would say this is one of the best overall midsegment smartphone."

Just for streaming 1 or 2 movies.If it is 90hz it only gives you 10 max but if you switch to 60hz it gives you 12hrs. Battery is not performing like they promised. Camera is good but not as good as earlier phones. Overall first impression is good except battery.

Otherwise overall a good phone at this price."
1118,Aniket Y.,Just perfect for the price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  It looks more premium in person! Everything sums up so perfectly, the 90 hz display makes it feel smooth!

Those who want a good os experience also can consider this.It is the entry of oxygen os.
1121,Vishnu,Display tint a new feature,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dont fall in trap. According to one plus, this phone has a new feature ""pink tint in display"" after knowing that it was a feature, I was so grateful.

1128,Komal,Buy 7t instead if you want a OnePlus.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Below average image quality. Selfies come with a halo around the head. Looks photopshopped. Disappointment! Do not buy if you want even a decent camera. Phones in half the price are offering better cameras as per my personal experience.

The probmem is with the ear phone as only bluetooth version can be used and that has to be bought separately which costs another 5000 rs. Exorbitant rate for a ear phone."

1446,Prasad,Most overhyped phone of 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars,  People who like dark themes should beware that OnePlus Nord has tint issues. I thought it wouldn't be a big problem but it definitely looks something like a damaged product in low brightness. The overall specs are decent but for a phone this price one should not expect any display issues.
1447,Anonymous,Worst thing in Oneplus nord,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bad thing about oneplus nord is that when you wants to record someone's call , it will say your call will be recorded. The other person will come to know that you will be recording the call.I advice oneplus to bring latest update and remove this automatic call recording message."
1448,AKHIL,Decent mid range phone,4.0 out of 5 stars,  Phone is pretty decent look wise. Battery drains slightly faster and to prolong battery life one has to keep it in battery saver mode most of the time. Camera works good except for low light photo.

4640,Aman More,A good daily driver.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera."
4641,Abhishek Agarwal,Bad bad camera,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review."
4642,Kiran KS,The original segment of One Plus,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok...."
4643,Nikhil,*Read before you buy!!*,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)"
4644,Deblina Roy,Disappointing,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved."
4645,Amit,Near to mid range  Perfection,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD"
4646,Sreeram,Totally dissatisfied. No AR support.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones.

4647,aishwarya,Great price!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time."

The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good."

The material is quite thin, just like so many Polo brands being sold on this website at throwaway prices. Thus, it raises the question if this is actually Allen Solly because, Polos being sold by the brand on their own website are priced at Rs 900 and above. The material is like an undervest. We all get taken in by the pictures advertised while the reality is quite different."

0,Rubesh Gain,Disappointed with touch,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am using kindle 8th Gen from last 3 years. Recently I have bought kindle 10th Gen. But after using 2 days I realized touch is little less responsive sometime, so had to tap twice or thrice. Even I got a replacement device after escalating this issue to amazon service. But the new device is also having same problem."
1,RAVITEJA ,Decent but battery life is unsatisfactory,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I usually never complain about Amazon products. Have purchased great many amazon basics stuff. This particular product isnt that appealing to me. I apparently didnt get that feel of 8000 in the product and the ""weeks of battery life"" is false. I charged my kindle upon its arrival and battery came down to 80% the same day? How is that possible? Still gonna give the product a few days and decide whether to exchange."
2,Guru,How did this Device get so popular?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product means well. I mean the 10th generation Kindle had that backlight after all, (besides the thousands of books in its library). But, What disappointed me was the ‘Flicker‘ (Or ‘pixelisation’) when I transitioned from one page to another or clicked on ‘home’. Disconcerting, Just couldn’t get used to it.  Activated page refresh, but there is zero change. After a point it became Plain irritating. ‘Black & White Format’ is it’s biggest stumbling block, since comics/pics can be great in colour. The device itself shouts ‘cheap plastic’. Could be better finished. Should be slightly narrower. Regarding usage, The UI isn’t smooth Always and took several touches, (sometimes), to act. Did it hang often? Not sure! How does one switch off the device? There is only the sleep option. These factors do not favour a ‘buy’. So if this is the famed Kindle, I wanted none of it. Sent it back"
3,Ankush,Performance need improvement,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I rate it 3 star only for performance issue. The device is quite slow, specially while change theme/ alignment it took 20s approx to update, that time the UI getting freeze.Price is quite high as compare to feature and performance.ePUB format does not supporting.But other than that, a book reader fall in love with this device. The the ambient light brightness is very swift even at dark. My reading experience is awesome.The screen looks like a real book page.TO KINDLE MANUFACTURER (AMAZON): -- Please look into the device performance. It's really works very slow for few functionality.- More ebook format need to be add. Specially ePUB is very popular for ebooks.- UI is supposed to more user friendly.- While I keep eBooks in separate folder from computer. Kindle does not show books folder wise, it list all the ebooks in library. That feature must be included in the next OS update.- Price is quite high as compare to feature."
4,vamshi,Kindle is good for 1 time investment but need more range on books cause that's the maintenance,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I think it would still take time for people in subcontinent to accept it with its price and the books which are available. I think the software navigation also is not too friendly with everyone working on mobiles and tabs going to home from mid of book seems not easy... and children collection was not good enough.. my kid of 11 was okay to shell out her pocket money for this but returned because of he age sized material not being there much... and with phones getting bigger and tabs also being used to read... material and range becomes even if people can put one time investment on kindle...doesnt makes sense to have ebook price same as hard cover..the maintainance would be high
5,saikat chatterjee ✔️,a perfect device for reading but....,3.0 out of 5 stars,  so after I purchase this product from Amazon its been days for receiving. I mean I have waited 8 days to receive this product.now here is my review after unboxing. the device has 49% off battery then I charged it up to 100% it took about 1 hour 15 minutes but when I used it it's drains the battery 10% after just a few minutes of reading now how could it provide me weeks of battery service.the product is really good it is really very good for reading although I have faced a problem with the free 3 months Kindle subscription. the terms and condition has no condition about the credit card system when I try to purchase the three month subscription of Kindle unlimited with 2 rupees I came to realise that it only takes credit cards so my 3 months of Kindle unlimited subscription gone waste. and here come to battery life I highly doubt that it will take up to 7 days if you are even a moderate reader it will last up to complete two day's not even close to 7 days.
6,Kuch bhi,Made in China,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I am totally satified with the product but it is made in china. India has such a huge population to buy this product then why can't they produce it in India.
7,DM,Battery life is a joke but does the job,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life is not as they claim to be.If you are someone who reads  for a long time like 2 -3 hours with backlight on (and wifi of) you have to charge it once in a week.Otherwise it is good .There is no problem with the touch and though people complain about Kindle being slow let me tell you that they are a fool.It is not as fast as your handset but it won't make you frustrated.Screen quality is also good looks like paperback little yellowish but does the job.
8,Amazon Customer,Kindle 10edn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Technically, this ereader satisfies all its promises. Built in light. Fonts, brightness adjustment- all very satisfying. The problem is in the content of what an Indian reader is allowed to read. For example, borrowing books from the library is not possible. The really good popular fiction by modern writers are not available as ebooks. Those that are available, do not make interesting reading."
9,Patz,"Everything is fair in love and war. An average device, but avid readers will love it, anyway",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got my first Kindle device after Diwali. First look found it quite attractive, though the design with thick edges feels quite outdated in these days of bezel less devices. The finish is matte, although it is quite slippery in hand (almost dropped the device yesterday! :-) ).The screen resolution is not very good, though it is not too noticeable during fast reading. Still, at this price point the screen resolution could have been much better. If you are using Full HD/ Full HD+ devices, the difference is quite prominent (on the first day I felt as if I had actually acquired power in my eyes! :-p ).The built in lights are fine. You can adjust the brightness as you need. If sufficient ambient light is available, you won't need to use the built in lights at all.The fonts available are quite easy on the eyes. You can adjust the font size, margins, text alignment and orientation as well.The touch is on the average side. While flipping pages left or right is good (by touching the left or right of the screen), scrolling is quite a pain in the a_. Really, Amazon could have done much better by providing a better touch screen. You have to literally drag your fingers on the screen to go up or come down. The finger touch is often not recognised. Also, many times a single touch causes multiple page turns instead of just one. These are just not acceptable at such a price.The battery is fine, ONLY if you turn off the WiFi and don't use the built in lights. WiFi eats the battery like anything. When I used the device first with WiFi on, I literally felt that I had received a faulty device that was draining in charge at an unimaginable rate. But once the WiFi is turned off, the battery performs very well, clocking -2% per hour (reminder: WiFi off, built in lights off). But again, I am sceptical, and have to use the device for some months before arriving at any conclusion on its battery life.The WiFi is fine and connects to available networks as soon as available. But the sync is quite cumbersome, and needs to be done again and again to discover files sent to the device.Charging time is considerable, but is excusable as Amazon doesn't claim fast charging or anything like that.The charge does not drain much while sleeping, hence eliminating the need to turn the device off when not in use. But I have not found any method to set the sleep timer when the device is left idle.The main point is that the device serves the  basic need of reading without putting stress on your eyes (unlike mobiles/ laptops).Overall, it is an overpriced item. I got it at 6249 during the Diwali sale, as compared to its marketed price of 7999, still I think that a price of 4500 would suit it considering the pros and cons of the device and it's basic design.I had saved a few bucks by avoiding spending much on clothes during the festive season, so I think this deal was not a  loss for me. Anyway, if you are an avid reader, and can excuse the basic design for your love of reading, you might go for this device.Love, P."
10,rahul,Very  Basic e-reader with minimalstic UI and less interactive.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the best devices for book/ e-reader lovers.I found a few things which could be done better at this price segment (7k)1.ppi is just not good, as the company flaunts.2. The refresh rate is too bad, (feels like a baby device)3.The sync feature doesn't work well (the device takes 3-5 mins just to refresh to show new books into the device.Overall it's okay if you get a deal under 5k. I got this Device for 5850 -(including 10% bank offer) in Aug Prime Day sale.If you are looking a reader by compromising the above points, you can go for it."
11,Prashanth CS.,Not great but can buy it as it is hyped.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Of course, the battery back up is excellent. Features are great. But, it flickers with every page flip.. Kinda irritating. In fact, I like to read books on mobile rather than this device. Generally if you consider, All I am paying for is for a screen and some cheap quality processor inside and very low memory. We can pay around 2k for this not more than that."
12,Ranjit Singha,"Good but its Black and white Screen, and all coloring image we see in Black and White color only.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good but its Black and white Screen, so the coloring picture you will see as black and white image only. I was not aware of this when I bough the device, neither this facts were clearly written in the product description, the device is functioning good. Received USB cable to charge(But no plugin pin to directedly charge from the electric power point)"
13,Rex,"Go for it, it's cool_Wifi is an issue",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Simply awesome, the only drawback it has is the internal memory of 2.5 GB, otherwise reading on this Kindle is a delight. Good job :-)The only issue I have started facing is the wifi - I have recently upgraded the wifi facility and since then my kindle has stopped supporting wi-fi.  Very annoyying!!!! It has same issues I had with my previous kindle, earlier I thought my existing kindle has issues but now it seems all of the kindles have wifi issues.  Once you change the wifi provider, problem starts.  Not happy at all!!!!!!!!"
14,Kunal,Battery life terrible,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The battery life is not what I had expected. Went down from 50% to 32% overnight in Airplane mode and Power saver enabled!Charging the battery since 3pm till next day 8am.. recharged upto 66%!!Replacing my device.. if issue still persists, will return!!"
15,sneh,Only for passionate readers,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  if you are passionate reader then its for you but if you are tech person love to explore gadgets then may be you wouldn't like it much as touch is not that good and also the touch response lag due to digital ink , only available in black and white so if you are buying this for study notes and reading purpose i would suggest and android tablet , or you can choose any tab with stylus feature, but your solely purpose is only book reading than its for you, good point is its  doesn't hamper your eyes and long battery life"
16,Xenon Neon,"Best for gifts, not for self-purchase.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Like:1- Distraction Free2- only one hand required for reading.3- Kindle cover works very well. Close the cover. Kindle will sleep, open the cover, resume the book where it was left.Dislikes:1- When compared to other e-book software, it's very bad. I, personally, didn't like the page turning animation. It's a screen refresh. Coming from google books, it's a downgrade.2- The text selection is horrible. Sometime it's impossible to select desired text. This review is motivated because of that thing only. I was reading a book, and wanted to highlight a text and after trying for 10 times, I got annoyed and here I am, writing this review.3- You cannot load epubs. Pdfs can be loaded.4- searches in the book not possible. What's the use of e-book if you cannot search for a phrase/word. 🤦🏻🤦🏻5- too expensive for the features provided."
17,Hori mahto,It's nice but..,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let me start with the cons.1.if you like to read Hindi books which are usually in PDFs, you'll need to use calibre to convert. The usual kindle conversion by email doesn't do the trick. Even the EPUB ones got their letters scattered sometimes. So you’ll need to use calibre.2. No EPUB support.3. Battery backup is bad. If you're an avid reader.Pros.1. Inbuilt light. Breeze to your eyes.2. Carta display.3. Resolution... although it's low but you won't notice Unless it's a book filled with pics or diagrams.Verdict: buy a kobo Clara HD if you can . I couldn't get it so I bought this."
18,Rohini Gore,Reading experience is good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  We can't send pdf, word files and other files directly on kindle as each time we have toconvert it into format supporter by kindle.Even though after conversion marathi Or language other than english pdf , it won't support in kindle.Also need to buy seprte kindle subscription."
19,Shubham M.,Battery is real issue doesn't last for week,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought in the hope that I'll get to read books and novels in that and I am not very disappointed by this device but it's battery which Kindle claims to last for weeks that is not true in my case or may be in many more people's case.I have seen them complaing about it quite often that it doesn't last for that long, I found that if I use in built light then my battery drains more faster than before so that's why 3 * for that too.Overall I am fine with the device and I hope it works well in future as well because I've doubt about it's durability. It's an excellent device for those who really love reading and it is not very heavy in weight so no strain in the hands but you can't hold it for long. Last but not the least that the Kindle is easy to get scratches so better to spend more 500₹ for a cover as well cause you won't like your new Kindle look old in the very first week."
20,Siva Chaitanya,Telugu  language  not supported,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kindle is good, the size entry level kindle is small, power button  could be better. I had seen kindle supports  regional  languages but telugu language is not supported.All the books which are in telugu are not able to be opened .In one of the sample books I saw options in telugu.  So kindle supports  telugu language  but don't know why they disabled it🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
21,Sumon Kumar Dey,Happy reading even at dark... Lasts days not weeks.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Previous edition was tougher. A small demand to Amazon... Please provide a strong battery. Battery is really an issue. It doesn't lasts for weeks with lights on even at twelve points. It can be challenged also. I am using Kindle for years. In seventh & eighth generation kindle I even forgot when I have charged. It lasts minimum 3 weeks reading 3 hours daily. Amazon must keep in mind while developing 10th generation kindle to give a robust battery as it has built in light. Last weeks is a JOKE nothing else...
22,sarika,Not satisfied,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I have been using the older version of all new kindle without built-in light for the last 5 years. Namaste when I bought this one I expected similar performance but am not fully satisfied with this kindle as compared to the old one this is a bit slow it takes time to turn pages and waking up and battery is not that efficient it doesn't stay for 4weeks. Sometimes the touchscreen is not responsive if we turn pages to right it goes left.
23,Abhishek ,Does its job,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Does its job of a reading a device. Though the touch response and screen refresh rate really really sucks. Considering there are no speakers/colour display/camera/good processor the price doesn’t justify the kind of touch response and screen refresh rate provided. Still for just reading with an all inclusive kindle subscription at 200/month it’s good.
24,ankit,So far good experience but just only one issue.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well it's a good product and avid readers but there are some limitations while readership other PDF,MOFI file while accessing from amazon kindle. The file format kind of scattered and I know why.Just dont like the way kindle handle other files like PDF.1. Not easy to move to kindle and even If you did, the format of the file would be not like you may expect.2. Though battery is really good.3. Screen brightness is also adjustable which is nice.4. Easy to carry anywhere."
25,NISHA DEV,That it might hang sometimes even if it is new,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I liked this product a lot but sometimes it hangs.I was also disappointed to know that even after spending 8000 for the kindle you still had to pay money for the books and for kindle unlimited
26,Swagatika Mohapatra,"It is a very nice product , but I am getting black dots on screen after scrolling some pages.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Black dots on screen distract me,  if it is not same in other product of kindle and it's only building  defect in my device than I would like to exchange it with a new one."
27,Sanjay naik,4 Gb is huge for books,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well, the product is great, huge storage for books, but some of the kindle books are not supported in this device especially competitive books. Navigation sometimes creates an issue otherwise it great to have such devices."
28,Peeush Anand,Not what i expected.  Disappointing.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  May be my hopes were high. But i am disappointed by the product. It is good to read books from kindle store only. As these are optimised for the device. We can add pdf to the device but then cannot change the font size etc. So it strain the eyes to read such small font. If use zoom feature than need to scroll right left up & down repeatedly.  The refresh time of screen is very poor takes 2 to 3 seconds to refresh.
29,Venu Gopal,Looks cheaper Chinese version,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Though I liked it for all that it was made for (reading at any time), I was quite surprised to see the cheap quality material of the Kindle. For this quality, price seems on the high side."
30,SANGRAM KISHORE JENA,1 week usage,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Slow response. Bit overpriced,  both ereader and cover. Used to be 2000 less 2years ago. Should have been less than that. Rest cool."

32,Debjit Adhikari,Expectation Demands,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too small for comfortable reading. Those who are perennial readers might find this too short for fast reading. I suggest they should go fo a larger version. The display is only 4.75""X3.5"""
33,nikhil m.,Battery Life isn't great. Only lasts a day.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a great ereader, but the only problem I have with it is the battery life. It's terrible and it runs out of charge in a day even though it's idle most of the time. I put it in airplane mode but still it runs out of charge. Amazon promises weeks of battery life but it doesn't even last a day."
34,Jaison Joseph,Lack of power adapter,3.0 out of 5 stars,  How can we know that which type of power adapter is suitable for it. I simply take the samsung power adapter and used the USB cable you provided and charged. I don't know its bad effect.So please give more information .
35,Tanmoyendu Ghosh,A colour display would be more appropriate.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  A color display would be more appropriate or it should have been mentioned that the display is entirely black and white so that at the time of buying the buyer can have a second thought. Honestly, I had no idea about the display and I personally think that reading pdfs in iPad is always a better and soothing experience."
36,Mutahhir,Ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Was expecting a lot more. Probably it was my mistake as I had not seen a kindle before.
37,Pranav,Good reader bad page view average battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The next page option is like an animation it would have been better if it was like scrolling through. Also when i received it it was 42% charged. But without even using it just registering amazon account and such reduced charge to 16%. I dont even hope to last weeks just a full day i suspect.

It does not throw light on your face like mobile/tablet/laptop.Please understand that there are NO, I repeat, NO service centres in India. For the 1st year while the device is still in warranty, you might even put your mistake on to manufacturer and get a replacement, but later on you might end up with a dead device.I dropped my kindle paperwhite in a flip cover for the first time since I bought it, screen developed a small crack and since it was out of warranty, I have a dead device now whose page I cannot flip! However awesome the technology in kindle might be, I am back to paper books and will never buy until they give me:1) Service centre in India2) Gorilla glass protection for the screen so that screen does not get damaged as mine!"

0,Amazon Customer,Totally unfair.. Feeling like cheated,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Amazon should give 1500 rs cashback to all those who bought this kindle in April... This is unfair.. I certainly do not like this price drop within a few days of the product launch.. I've just purchased this at rs 7999 a few days ago.. Now it is selling at rs 6499 😞
1,Rahul Bhat,Oh!!..they made me an idiot!,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought 2 kindles during prelaunch period for 16k and today I am feeling like an idiot.Reasons:1. There is a drop in price by 1500..so effectively lost 3000.2. The promised prelaunch offer of additional 2yr warranty worth 2400 hasn't materialised inspite of repeated reminders. Guys Amazon doesn't keep up to it's promise.So effectively lost 5400..would you find a bigger idiot than me!!.Guys!..if you are planning then buy now..not when they hike it back to 8k.Recent development: May 11thThe Kindle promotion team hasn't yet decided on the fate of my warranty offer and has postponed till May 22nd.Seems the fate of India and the warranty will be decided on the same day.Till then..I am still an idiot made by Amazon
2, merlin varghese,Never buy it. Low quality product!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Is Amazon selling low quality products??I brought my Kindle on 7-5-19.The first look of the product was just satisfactory. We could adjust the brightness but the software was so slow to load and the battery life was not that good.Yesterday (30-5-19) I discovered a new problem. Before going to bed, the charge of the Kindle was 51% . When I woke up it was reduced to 15%. I couldn't believe it.So in order to test that problem,I left it charged. After getting full charged I removed the socket and kept it without using it. After 3 hours the charge was reduced to 54%, I don't understand. I haven't used it but it's battery life is just getting worse.I need Kindle customer service to do what's necessary.."
3,rahul gupta,Unfair pricing,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pre ordered from Amazon at mrp. Nothing new additions from previous gen. And see what Amazon did just 20 days from launch it reduced the price by 1500. Did not see this coming, absolutely cheated by Amazon. It's as good as buying previous generation."

5,athul jyothis,Amazon fooled those people who bought it on release day,1.0 out of 5 stars,  1500 + 650 = 2150 off now just after 20 days of release. Amazon should refund at least 1500rs back to those people who trusted them and bought the device on release day.PNBattery backup is not good. It would only last a week at its maximum.
6,Kindle Customer,Not so good,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is so small than my smartphoneI buy amazon kindle first time, I shocked when I saw that display is black and white,I never expect itwhenever we turns the pages the glitches are irritatingIt's price is nearly 10000 with cover,but the storage is just 3 gb,but kindle books have more size,so I think that it is not fit for me,because I need to buy more booksI don't think that it is possible to read comics books in it,because it is in black and whiteIt is also not a good experience to read maths,science and engineering books in it,the formulas are not typed goodI buy two Indian digital signal processing practicing books in kindle,I read them with my android mobile phone but with my kindle device it shows that the books format is not supportingBut I have no problems with tamil novels and english books,the reading experience is so good for plain readings"
7,devendra mahisury,Worst product if u purchase to read during night,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst experience using Kindle device. It's not having night mode option in which u can change your background colour black and read for hours. I started headache as I start reading and in morning I feel dizziness for hours.Even they didn't mention this feature on product package or Amazon website. Even Amazon not helping me through just simply update of software. They even don't concern someone's health issues. It's better to read on smartphone using night mode option. Why someone waste RS 8000 for this product. Really shame on Amazon for not giving basic feature for readers even charging such high cost for this device.
8,Shaukath Ali,Keep the releasing offer promise,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I didn't get the the releasing offer .. free one year warranty and free voucher for 200 rupees

10,dilip vala,"Slow, irritating and utter waste of money.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Kindle is not easy to read device.there are many features in the other devices which can help save your eyes. The performance is not good. It is really really slow. It waste so much of time reading the book. And it irritates when changing pages, it flickers. And at this price u should be giving the people the device which is littel faster. And i can't even read a page after zooming in. And reading graphic images is nearly impossible. What if I want to read a newspaper. Well I can't. And I don't. Because it's not easy to read in this device. Slow, irritating. Utter waste of money. I don't even use it anymore. And one last thing. It's build is so cheap. It can't be this much costly."
11,BR,"Product is good, storage not",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Though product is excellent, I am giving it 1 rating since my experience with device Storage has not been good.Actually,I  bought 8 GB device on 29th Aug and received it on 30th. On checking , storage was showing as 5.93 GB free out of 6.23 GB.I immediately replaced it. Again, I received it with same storage. When I contacted the technical team of Kindle, they said that device is of 8 GB only but it won't be written anywhere as rest storage are taken by our software.I didn't believe him and so, returned the product and reordered again since you can't replace the product more than once.When I received New one on 2nd Sep, still it is having same storage, 5.93 GB free out of 6.23 GB.Finally ,I kept it as my sone, being an avid reader, doesn't want to wait any longer...."
12,vidya sagar sivaratri,Product is good in some respect but has got serious limitations,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought kindle 10th generation basic device, to read by subject related books as its been mentioned in description that it supports pdf files. its really a pain to read pdf files on kindle and if you format to mobi file then it becomes even more complicated, texts appear fine but diagrams, tables etc doesnt work at all.as well as navigation in these files is cumbersome.kindle is only for novels kind of books not for technical subject related books. its a very important point to all future potential buyers."
13,Manish Kumar Mishra,Horrible battery life powered by Horrible Amazon Customer Service,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Kindle which I received needs charging everyday. Even my mobile requires charging every 1.5 days. I was under the assumption that the Kindles take very few charging requirement. Not for this one. The customer service of Amazon is also very bad. When I try to click on ""Return or Refund"" product in app, it takes me to the Home page of Customer service. I again have go through the convoluted set of menus to reach the section for Return or Refund of product. Clicking on that option, places a automated call which sends a link via SMS. Now, that link, again takes back to the Home page of Customer service. This doesn't make any sense. If this is how Amazon is treating its ""Prime"" customers, May God Bless the Non-Prime ones."
14,Amazon Customer,Worst product and service,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had use kindle device only a month. Display shows linings which is problematic while reading, I complaining about device amazon customer care talked to exchange within 48 hrs but it is already one and half month gone. Poor service and poor reading experience on kindle. Its touch is not working properly. Also some Amazon kindle books not open in kindle device. Worst product, I suggest to buy tablet instead buying kindle."
15,Rajesh,Do not buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered on prime day and received this afternoon (13th august). Black spots appeared on the display when I tried to type my account details to get started or scroll. On touch, every single time. The battery was draining at a faster rate(than they promise). About the return policy, the package is designed in a way that you have to cut open the seal to take the device out but the policy for returning the device says the package has to be in manufactured condition and the only other option is a replacement. As told by some users who have brought around the same time as me, even the replacement device turned out to have the same fault. Will wait and see how my possible return and refund goes."
16,Joydeep,Came with a slight scratch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well though the scratch is small and on one top edge of the screen, hopefully, it won't really bother me while reading but when you buy a brand new product you expect it to be the way it was advertised."
17,Jai G,"Not working on second day itself, froze on home screen even after resets",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this, was excited. The screen froze on wallpaper within mere 12 hours. I reset it thrice, no use. My account is logged in, my books are in there. But I can’t access anything in it. When i try to turn it on, the led gets lit up and then after 5 whole seconds screen gets refreshed to show the wallpaper again. Even when it was working it’s light was weird. It’s battery gets discharged too rapidly when wife is connected. Even without wifi you will have to charge it every 5-7 days. It can’t go on for “weeks and weeks” like amazon claims. Returned it, as replacement always brings refurbished items from amazon."
18,Amazon Customer,Never buy it,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Very very bad experience.my kindle have stopped working after 5 months . I really don’t understand what type of product amazon give to us. I will never ever buy kindle in my life .

21,raghav,hardware bug - Unable to install the software update,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've bought this on 15 Aug 2019. I tried to download the books and had to face challenges to download and payment by one click. I was told to download the software update and install it manually from the link https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6S6CFCKHUNX9HUV. However, after manually transferring the file to kindle the kindle device shows the update error. Contacting the Amazon device team suggested there is a hardware issue. I am perplexed by what kind of service from Amazon that they can ship a device which is faulty. I am totally disappointed by Amazon not finding and ensuring the trusted brand"
22,Chandan Garg,Defective piece replaced by a refurbished piece.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I rec'd my Kindle e reader soon after placing the order. The issue was that the device almost everytime had issues in connecting it to the Wi-Fi network. The network itself didn't have any issue coz all other phones and laptops never had a connectivity issue. Even upon soft reset a couple of times and a hard reset, the problem persisted. So, the agent agreed to replace it. But to my shock, the replaced item I rec'd is a refurbished piece. First they send me a defective piece and on getting it replaced, they send me a refurbished item. Slow clap."

0,Plan N Design,Looks like Windows XP in the era of Windows 10,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought it in the name of smart tv and cheap price. I'm disappointed with majorly two points:1. Poor picture quality. I had Full HD connection. And, the quality is superb on my another TV (Samsung smart tv). But, the quality is so bad that I confirmed from my provider whether the connection is running on HD!2. There is no Amazon Prime, Netflix App support in app. And, they are promoting their shitty patchwall app.This TV is good for people experiencing their first smart tv and that too in tight budget.Else, dont go for this TV. Samsung is best in this business."

2,Raminder s.,Low grade Lala type company,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  MI is really a useless company. They have launched this TV but its remote doesn't switchon the TV, evertime you have to go near tv to switch it on with button given underneath. The technician says the company has not launched the upgrade for remote. It really sounds stupid on MI's part. So far in last 3months of usage i have to call once the technician for service as tv was not working due to software problem. In service center you have to give your billing details everytime you call as they don't have software to keep your call and billing record."

0,Amazon Customer,"Just a thick Sponge, Not a yoga mat !",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Do not buy!The only plus point about this mat is that it is thick. But that is itIt is just a thick piece of sponge, not a yoga mat.It does not have the grip that a yoga mat must have. Keeps slipping.Also, after hardly 2 months of use, it has developed scratches and tears.It also expands in every direction and makes doing yoga more difficult rather than easy !"
1,Mohan,Don't buy this products,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is not useful for yoga.. just after one day usage ,it became like shown in picture.. when it delivered ,it was so soft.. but totally sponge is there inside.. it is not sticking to ground while doing yoga.. dont buy this mat.."

6,Indian Citizen,Not good for yoga,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The essence of Yoga is its Stretches. Boy you can not do stretch asanas and poses on this mat. So basically you can't do Yoga on this mat. Waste of money. Instead of buying this, one must invest in the EVA foam mats like that of Aerolite. You can search for 'EVA foam yoga mats' in the search bar or directly make purchase from the brand (like Aerolite)"
7,Amazon Customer,Bad quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat is of very bad quality. The at slips on a tiled living room floor. When you do balancing positions on the yoga mat you can clearly feel the mat slipping away!!! This is very risky and harm your muscles and joints.  Please DO NOT BUY.I got fooled thinking that its expensive ( bought for 999)  and of amazon brand so must be good.The quality is worse than the 400rs mar which I used earlierNow moved to decathlon mat. Bought the 1299 variant. Quite good !!! I am happy with it .
8,VENKATESH NORIS,Not Worth....,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Have been using this mat for few months now.

Moves from one corner to other corner of the room.. Writing this review after a good 2 months use and trying to make it work all this while.. But now its got dangerously slippery.. Avoid for yoga pls

0,Hiren raval,Three Stars,3.0 out of 5 stars,
1,Marshall,Slippery !,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very SlipperySome standing and moving practices are really tough to doBody is not able to balance itselfI recommend to try some other6 mm yoga mat is just perfect for this purposeI have used that beforeThis one was a mistake !
2,Kindle Customer,It's soft but not stable and comfortable and,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mat is very soft and but not comfortable,It is  not slipping but it is stretching.I'm don't want to belittle the product with confusing terminology,  but just to make A'basics  team that, being soft and providing cushion are not the only requirements for a yoga mat. It must stay in position, while performing poses such as standing Twists, bends and stretches etc.The problem with this mat is that, it stretches when I'm  performing standing Twists and making me to loose balance and dimensions of posture.  While performing chakrasana, it may also lead to spinal disc slippage or rupture injuries.I'm expecting adding stability  for this mat also retaining its softness.Please consider these points while developing premium version of this mat."
3,Usha Krishnan,Good but should be more durable,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Got this thicker yoga mat as I had pain on my knees with thinner mat. It is very much comfortable for knees and provides good cushioning. However the mat has started wearing off after just 3 months of usage. Plus it is also only one sided, so the life of the mat is shorter than expected"
4,Sudharsan Chakravarthy,This is a matress and not a mat. Please know it before buying.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This thick piece of rolled up cushion can be used as a substitute just in case if you’ve any difficulties in postures. This may be useful only for beginners but not for regular use. This product is easily tearable just by sliding on it and it’s freaking sticky with no smell. Children will love it because of the sponge cushioning which is soothing for them to sleep on it.I returned it because it came with a tiny hole at the bottom and they blow dried the sponge - trying to adjust the hole but ended up messing it.
5,Deepak,"Skids off over tiles and marble, though comortable",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a good mat for Grass or non silppery surface. This mat Skids over smooth surfaces like tiles, marble floors. So becomes Risky. The upper surface is super comfortable, you can probably sleep on it. So best for camping, travel.But the lower surface of mat does not stick to floors causing it to skid, which can be risky."
6,Akif,"Light weight, thick but not too quality",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I found the mat comfortable and soft. It is really light weight. However, material doesn't looks durable. Product I received today has a mark of blade or cutter.I could have given 4 rating but had to reduce 1 point for the cut mark."
7,Amazon Customer,Soft mat but not thick enough,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It is not exactly 1/2 inch. It's much thinner than expected. The material is quite soft so it does really cushions the knees. I have to start using it every day and then will be able to judge it's durability.
8,Tarun Kalra,Not good quality,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is extra thick but the foam and construct is bad quality, pressure from toes/fingers have already caused the foam to break and fray at places. didn't expect this low quality from amazon basics at this price."
9,siddharthrai83,Only good for light yoga  excercises,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The thickness is good however it is only effective for doing light yoga exercises. The surface tends to get slippery when you sweat. You might end up hurting your self.
10,Amazon Customer,Good cushioning but not durable,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is good for people who have weak knees/wrists and need proper cushioning to perform different poses. Easy to carry. Size is good.However, this isn't really a yoga mat and seems like a piece of foam - which would not create any trouble at the beginning but may not be durable. You would observe small wear and tear with each day of use."
11,Amazon Customer,The mat skids :),3.0 out of 5 stars,  The thickness is good and the size is perfect but the only problem is that the mat skids. The product/manufacturer should make design change at the bottom of the mat so that it do not skid on tiles or wodden floor when we are doing yoga or some other floor exercise.
12,Vipin Panwar,Smells like burnt tyre,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is rubbery, spongy and thick but smells pretty bad.  Might not be good for people with sensitive skin. Chinese product."
13,Siddhartha,Good product but can be improved,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is soft and had good grip to it, though slipps on smooth surfaced floor, can have some grip added towords bottom. Light and easy to carry yoga mat for sure but durability of product is an issue, ordered two one came with little dent thingy right off package."
14,Aneesh,Comfortable but slippery on floors,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is comfortable to use and thick enough for hard surfaces, one major drawback it doesn’t stick to the surface, if you stretch you will get imbalance as the mat stretches with you in both directions. I use it over a carpet so it holds the mat firmly, but then no point in buying extra thick."
15,Reader005,Delivers on the thickness front but not great as far as anti slip properties go,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Delivers on the thickness front but not great as far as anti slip properties go. Would not recommend for yoga. Returning this.
16,Swaroop,It's fine but not great,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  We can observe our legs and hand marks which goes deep, while using for yoga on the mat.Could be better as price is costly. Need some more thickness for longevity."
17,A.S.L,Poor grip for balancing,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Certain Asanas like Trikonasana , Surya Namaskar require strong base to stand on but this mat is 13mm provides excessive cushion and thus body balancing is quite difficult. Might be suitable for other use where better cushion effect is required."
18,Dixit Harsh,Try and look for other better options,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's big enough for a 6 feet tall but I feel it very soft and quality feels not great. Sharper object can easily tear this material
19,ayang,Nice,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It is thick and soft. Nice one but too soft that it doesn’t look like it will run long. It makes sound of u jump on it.
20,Gautamcd,Very thick yoga mat,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat thickness is good. It is good for someone having joints problem. But many would not like the mat too be too thick. The mat tends to skid while performing standing exercise.
21,Amazon Customer,Not a durable mat,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The material is soft and spongy making it less durable for workouts. The mat is not long lasting as it gets torn from ends when using regularly. Product is not worth the price
22,Saurabh,Could be better if had grooves for grip at bottom,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Has a thick and soft cushion, not suitable for use on tiles indoor as it does not have grip at the bottom and the mat looses form while performing body stretches which makes it very inconvenient, could be a good product for outdoor use"
23,Chakra,"Not worth the cost, less durable",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It has already started to loose shape in the places we stand or put pressure on, within a month."
24,Sneha,Ok ok product,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's a good but if you are into intense yoga it's not good as it stretches and slips in between.. you have to keep adjusting it in between.. if you are beginner go for it then.. it lasted me nearly 2-3 months
25,Amazon Customer,No Carrying strap is given,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good. Thick, comfortable. But difficult to carry if it's without carrying strap. And though mentioned in product description, it was NOT given."
26,Sunil,No grip on the underside,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's a good mat except that it slips. The underside has no grip so the mat slips while you are exercising.
27,Dheeraj Sawlani,A big sponge,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want a sponge so that floor won’t hurt you, its ok.But it is definitely not a real mat."

32,T.R. Padmanabhan,Too spongy & stretches,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The cushioning, while it gives comfort, is not ideal for some exercises. It also tends to stretch in some exercises. Also, could have ideally been a little wider."

163,bhanu,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product.  Quality to be improve
164,arun,Becareful when you buy this,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It slips on marble floor but works 'ok' on rough surface
165,nikhat pawane,Could be better,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Well it's pretty thick so if thats what your looking for them great. I do basic training on it with indoor shoes but they leave an impression after just one use. Quality could be better.
166,Bohan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this because needed a thicker mat for home exercise. It is really comfortable. Soft and padded which makes active exercises on it great. Much easier on the knees.The Bad: Durability is a problem. After a couple of uses, the mat has marks all over it (see picture) and the edges are fraying a bit. The carrying straps that came with it leave marks in the mat. Only using the mat with socks or bare feet so this shouldn’t happen as quickly.Also, saw a mat that looked and felt exactly the same at Winners for $20."
167,Alfa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's nice to have something that is so soft for floor exercises.  But too many other issues to make it not practical.  First its too big to carry around, so its best suited for home use.  Second it smells of chemicals so you need to air it out for a while before you can use it.  I had it in the garage for two weeks before I could bring it back inside.  The surface is very fragile and doesn't look like it will last, I used a friends and saw that it already had knicks and tears.  It's ok for hte money, but if you want something durable and portable, look elsewhere."
168,Emmanuel Er-Chua,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very average exercise mat. I needed something for at home use, as I have hard wooden floors. It helps prevent your tailbone from hurting when exercising, but is still not very comfortable. On top of that, it is easily creased (looks like dents) and does not go back into shape fully.It is also very difficult to pack up with the included handle loop. You can definitely find better, even at this cheap price. I would not recommend this, as I'm not very satisfied with my purchase."
169,Tyler Cruz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  As a 200-lb man, standard Yoga mats hurt my knees. This thick mat is very comfortable to use, but unfortunately it's not the most durable thing - little flecks of it will eventually wear off. I'm not the first person to write this, but it's not like the whole thing will disintegrate after one use. It is comfortable, but will probably only last 6-12 months of regular use before it probably needs replacing."
170,Liz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is reasonably priced, but there are a few things I think potential buyers should know:1. You can't wear shoes on this matI learned this the hard way, after my sneakers scuffed up the mat after a workout session. I could probably have ended up tearing my mat if i continued to wear shoes while using it. Barefoot or socks only if you wish to keep it in good condition for longer.2. It's slippery when wetThis thing turns into a slip-and-slide if you drip sweat on it. Not fun when trying to downward dog.3. It tends to move around a bit during use.Not a huge issue, but it can be annoying at times.All things considered, I like this mat. It fit my budget, and it's a good size. It's my first, so i have nothing to compare it to. But it did fall short in some areas that mattered to me."
171,William,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this for a family member for christmas, fast foward to now with little usage of it, it became scarred with marks of use. Though the pro being that it's comfortable with how thick it is, would recommend finding something more lasting in the future."
172,Michael L.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I expect a fair deal when I pay for something and unfortunately this product came in a broken box where the side of the cardboard box was ripped off and exposed the product. Who know what else is taken from the box? Now there is a HUGE permanent dent on the yoga-mat. Anyways, it's a yoga mat for myself and the thickness is good enough for all my yoga/pilates, but objectively it's far far far far far far away from a 5-star experience. Also the surface is somewhat sticky sometimes so jokes on you if you decide to sweat!"
173,Lindsay K.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this to bring to classes at the gym and it slides around the floor too easily, especially when doing plank walk outs, push ups,  etc. I'll probably keep it for at-home workouts on top of our area rug, but if you plan on using it on hardwood or any other type of slippery flooring, it won't work well as there's not enough traction."
174,Vandana Bhalla,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It does the job for the most part. It provides extra cushioning which is what I had wanted. Cons are that it doesn't have very much grip and it tears very easily. My dog decided to stretch on the mat and his nails tore a hole in the mat. I don't expect it to last very long but it wasn't very expensive either.
175,Freddy P,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  not the best yoga mat around but does the job and I'm satisfied with it. Thick and soft prevent's pressure on joints.If you stretch it out too much the surface of the mat will get small wrinkles in it. Comes with a handy carrying strap.Its super light to carry
176,Sylvia P.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is great for exercises, but in my opinion, too thick for yoga.  I had a hard time trying to balance myself while standing on one leg because the mat is thick and soft."
177,Mags,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I love the thickness of this mat but it does get damaged easier than you think and is extremely slippery. I couldn’t even do a plank on it with shoes on and these are non slippery high quality workout shoes.
178,Ryan M Buxton,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is a great mat, nice and thick, and comfort level is awesome.  However, it arrived with at least 4 cuts or tears in the mat, which has me worried about durability.  It appears that at least one of the cuts is most likely from a box opener slipping through."
179,NativeDiva,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is not durable at all. It is nice and think and it is very soft but, it's definitely not durable. I bought the pink one and the colour is very bright. Just wish it was more durable."
180,tessa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is honestly a very comfortable soft yoga mat but I wouldn’t suggest using it for doing yoga because it stretches underneath the weight of your body and it doesn’t stay in place  very easily. But if you’re looking for something that’s easy on your hands Or you wrists this is a good option
181,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Me gusta mucho el grosor del tapete ya que me duele mucho las rodillas cuando hago yoga, pero este tapete me a ayudado con eso. Lo que no me gusta es que desde el primer uso se arrugo mucho y se le hicieron pequeñas grietas."
182,Daniel C,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I find this mat slides very easily. It has little friction so the mat moves whenever I try to jumps. It is also not as durable as I thought. I already find dents and scratches after two uses.
183,Jenna,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall, it’s a decent product and it serves its purpose. The quality of the mat isn’t great, but it doesn’t make it any less usable; cosmetically, it bugs me. I’ve only used the mat a couple of times, but I’ve noticed that the straps used to carry it have left permanent indents which are quite noticeable. Other than that, unlike most reviews, mine hasn’t worn anywhere else."
184,Sara Jean,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A great colour but appeared with a few dents and scuffs. Works great! But I'd bought what appeared to be the same product when I lived in Scotland and it was much better quality than the one that arrived to me in Canada. Which was a little thinner and very dented.
185,Chun Wu,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  You pay for what you get, the mat is comfortable but unfortunately after 2 weeks of just doing situps and pushups on the exercise map I can see the wear and tear showing up on the mat and it is starting to pull apart.."
186,Paul N,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Probably not the best for flow yoga or balancing.  The mat will slide on the floor and is squeaky when moving on it, which can be disturbing.For stationary exercises, though, the padding is helpful to avoid knee pain."
187,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just received this mat today.  It is a nice colour, thick and comfy however didn't receive the carrying strap????  Therefore only giving this 3 stars."
188,Alissa G.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This yoga mat is FAT! Which is nice but it's bulky and makes it hard to commute with. But if you want some cushion, this is a good one for you."
189,Rach,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Super soft but did show wear and tear after just two cardio workouts. I will continue to use now. Would not buy again
190,Angela Cee,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great thick mat for core exercises at home. Thickness of mat makes balancing harder in yoga. More of a delicate material, my dog's nails have made tiny holes in it."
191,Michal Aizikov,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got the pink colour and it's super cute. If you have a tailbone issue the thickness is amazing for support. Although, it smells a little funny, it did come with holes and is very easy to stain/rip."
192,James.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product arrived as expected, is thicker than most yoga mats. Really liked it for doing yoga moves, stretches, however only had  this for a month and already some gouges in it. Won't order this brand again."
193,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The quality of foam is too spongy, not as compact as other professional Yoga Mat. Still okay at this price.  But I will consider to pay more for a better quality Yoga Mat in future when I need to replace this one."
194,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very soft and great support for the bad knee that u bought it for! However, the rubber marks & smudges very easily and gets worse and worse each time I use it. This photo was from one month of use. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that your stability and balance won’t be as good on it because it’s very cushy :)"
195,Julie Deshaies,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  J'ai eu ce tapis il y a quelques jours et déjà apres quelques utilisation, il est strié. C'est bon si on le garde en place tout le temps mais si on le replie et déplie, il se magane très rapidement. Pour le prix, je suis insatisfaite de la durabilité."
196,Jèr D,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Long but very narrow. Strange fit/sizing for sure...Also, it's too thick. It still can be handy sometimes."
197,JC,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Size is adequate, very comfortable on it.  After using it for a few weeks, many tiny tear appeared."
198,Mauri,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  im happy for the produc but i received and is missing the black strap , i didnt make a big deal about it but is good product"
199,Sri,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a good yoga mat, but it is quite slippery on my laminated ""wood"" flooring. Just wished there were some anti slip material underneath."
200,M,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good yoga mat, long enough and very comfortable. Only issue is that I havent recieved the strap with it, which makes it really difficult to take out of the house. It was disappointing, didnt realize it comes with a strap until now."
201,Chris Cornett,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not sure how long it will last .. but over all super happy with it for the cost.. seen ones three time more expensive.. not much better.
202,darling,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat thickness is great and it's helped alleviates knee and wrist pain. The mat did not come with the carrying strap.
203,Client d'Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Le tapis semble bien reçu hier donc pas essayer encore ... mais déçu je n’ai pas reçu la sangle de transport...
204,Edgar Ramirez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Llevo más de un año con él y me ha servido a la perfección. Con el tiempo pierde un poco de su efecto acolchonado en las zonas que recargas los codos y las rodillas.
205,Client d'Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It is already starting to crack after 2 weeks of (3 uses)
206,annthia,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Came defective. But not major for it to be returned. Comfy. Thicker than most mats. Pretty long in height.
207,S.M,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  does the job, low quality tho, recommend to spend more and get a decent one"
208,Alvaro Ruiz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Súper cómodo y acolchonado, pero se resbala sobre pisos lisos y no te permite hacer las posiciones de forma correcta, pues no se adhiere al piso."
209,Sandro Lucato,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is very comfortable, but it doesn’t seem like it’ll last very long. The bottom is slippery, not great for a yoga mat."
210,Ivan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perfect for doing simple stretching.  But if doing flow or positions like downward dog, warrior 2 etc, the mat provides low traction and will stretch out.  Not ideal"
211,MARC LAURIN,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  i received the item ok but the Carrying Strap where not included
212,Carlos Zegarra,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The quality of the Mat was not as high as I expected.The strap was very cheap. It broke after using it three times.
213,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s not very durable.. i find the material deteriorated after 5 uses/sessions ish .. lots of dents and holes .. its pretty soft and comfortable but not durable at all
214,Jen Henwood,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great mat however it did not come with a carrying strap. Without the strap, it’s very hard to take from place to place."
215,Alejandra Abad,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Esta Muy grueso,  el material no se ve de calidad y no me pareció funcional,  ni práctico."
216,schoolboykev,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not really the best quality. Wears out easily. Okay for simple mat exercises.
217,Andréia Silva Cardoso,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It smell very strong.
218,Blair Steele,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I recieved my yoga mat without the strap, now traveling with it or tucking it away is more difficult, especially with its thickness."
219,Canek,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pro. Es grueso y acoginado. No sientes la rigidez del piso.Contra. Es demasiado flexible, lo que genera inestabilidad para algunos ejercicios, pues se estira y se mueve demasiado."
220,Charles Guo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Rips and tears a bit too easily. But it's cheap though.
221,Someone,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  after a week of use the mat started to show heavy wear! not impressed by it. Although it is comfortable to work on.
222,Noreen,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Cheap but cool
223,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Somewhat starts to tear, as it is foam not rubber! But overall good!!"
224,Cliente de Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Funciona, pero posiblemente uno un poco más delgado sirva mejor"
225,Danial Hasan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I love the thickness of the mat it looks really well made however am very disappointed that carrying strap did not come with the mat.
226,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I use the mat for practicing yoga 3x a week. Very good not slippery. My objection is difficult to roll, strap is not long enough."
227,karen l.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Muy bonito y cómodo pero llegó con un olor muy desagradable 🤮 costo mucho quitárselo
228,Gerry Cellucci,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  No strap included. One of the reasons I purchased the mat was for the carrying strap.Mat is thick and looks comfortable
229,Saúl,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  En la publicación dicen que incluye Carrying strap, pero es falso, solo me llegó el mat."
230,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good. Works. But smells like plastic...
231,Cliente de Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Llevo 1 mes probandolo en concreto y funciona hasta el momento.
232,Ashley D.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This may is VERY comfy but it started breaking kind of fast so a bit sad about that
233,Luis Roberto,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  El material es demasiado resbaloso y se estira haciéndolo inestable para realizar deporte.
234,Alexandra,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It cracked and you slide, not good for yoga, but exercise i guess, its confortoble!"
235,michele pilon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Yoga nécessite toutefois une couverture de yoga évite de glisser
236,Sophie_dancer_07,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  felt kinda cheap and when used for a while it really squished down
237,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is soft and comfortable, but slippery and has strong rubber odor."
238,Sarah,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Works great
239,Paula Polanco,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Tiene muy buen grosor pero al contacto con piso liso se resbala
240,Jade,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Ok
241,Rajan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Used few times and it started to rip off
242,DiP,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great mat, but arrived damaged with puncture marks in it."
243,Jolka,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's nice and thick but while exercising with shoes on I noticed it's getting damaged a bit
244,Lea-Ann J.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I ordered black and received green. :(
245,Yovxmailen C Lozada Ma,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good really thick . Came quick .
246,Conor B,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I didn't recieve a carrying strap with it
247,Jorge Ernesto Robledo Reyes,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  No sé adhiere nada a superficies planas
248,Sophie,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not the best for yoga
263,Yamada Avegail,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Smell not good.
264,Andres Irizarry,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  To be expected for the price, but not a quality product.The pad itself has permanent crease out of the box.  The bottom has no grip to the floor so I'm due to my lack of flexibility I stretch this thing like a sponge.The obvious plus is the fact that it's thick so if you're like me and have knee pain when kneeling down, it will do its job as a cushion against the floor.If I had the chance to test this out in a store, I wouldn't buy it."
265,Serum,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got into yoga in August of 2018 as a way of managing my acute anxiety, so it was only a matter of time before I started practicing at home and away from the studio. I got this mat with an Amazon gift card I got for Christmas, and it's a very nice mat, very thick, very comfortable but the listing for it says it comes with a carrying strap-- it does not. I was disappointed when I opened up the box it came in and discovered that there was no carrying strap, but rather a piece of tape binding the mat in its rolled up position. I found this very disappointing because other than that it's a fine mat."
266,W. May,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first yoga mat. I wanted something comfortable- the mats at the Y were very thin and my knees really hurt. The mat came in on the same day I had class; so I excitedly ripped open the box and headed out the door.The plus side was that my knees never hurt once. Yin yoga doesn’t take a tremendous amount of balance, so I didn’t have any issues there. Sounds good, right?But no. While these attributes were great, the mat was incredibly squeaky. Every time I moved or shifted, there was loud squeaking. I am sure it was distracting to others and it was embarrassing to me.Since I’m still new to yoga, I didn’t want to spend a fortune on a mat. This one seemed to be a great option. But not so much in reality. Quite disappointing."
267,Shane Rogers,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pro: these ""yoga mats"" are thick and relatively soft.Con: This mat is too bulky to be considered portable, and it doesn't look like a traditional yoga mat. It's a hefty chunk of molded foam, like an industrial gym-mat. You'll look a little silly walking into a yoga class with one of these monstrosities bulging under your arm.If function is vastly more important to you than form, by all means, hit the ""buy"" button. But there are better options if you want a portable and classy yoga mat."
268,KitKat😺,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got this mat as photograph bcuz I have a hard floor for comfort which definitely less knee, palm and pressure pain while doing yoga positions. I like the length and color but hate as second photo shows, indents which does not go away fast enough, mat slides and I feel the mat stretching when I'm changing yoga position causing me to constantly reposition vs being fluid with my movements/ exercise."
269,Kat,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I did not have the smell other reviews complained about. I do love the straps it came with. I needed a thicker mat for more comfort on my wrists and for some of the other workouts I do. I really thought I was going to love this mat when I first started using it. However, after my first use it started getting scuffed. I’ve now had it for a month or so and it’s all scuffed up. I haven’t had a problem with it sliding, and it is longer which is nice for taller people or anyone that wants more space on their mat for certain exercises or workouts."
270,GibyJ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice thickness, and fairly light. Stinks to high heaven of 'plastic smell"" Same after 3 days as the first day I received it, so it does not seem to be declining fast. Having said that, you do have to get your nose within a couple of inches to get a bad whiff, so I could do my exercises and Pilates without any discomfort - there is not much face down stuff in my routine. Will stick with it for a while in the hope the outgassing stops. Mat is out in the sun right now - I'm hoping UV will help"
271,happyshopper,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've had this mat for over a year, and it has held up very nicely, being used 4 times a week for a year.  Love how cushioned it is! I use it for yoga, and also for ab exercises.  It has kept a great thickness so back and feet and hands are cushioned and hold where you put them during exercises.  The only reason I gave this 3 starts is because the mat slips (not your body) a lot.  On hardwood and also on carpet.  So with any type of movement exercise you need to be aware ahead of time to adjust yourself.I still would recommend the mat, just maybe only for floor work and not so much for yoga type exercises."
272,JenPhx,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Due to COVID protocol, participants must bring their own mat to circuit boxing so I purchased this one. It has good padding & doesn't slip too much but boy it has a funky smell that just isn't dissipating. Sometimes when I unroll it at the gym I'm a little taken aback & embarrassed by the smell. Once it's flat on the floor it's ok but I have to roll & unroll each class & that initial stinky smell (kind of like fish food) wafts in the air. I've been cleaning the mat & have been using it for several weeks. Sounds like some people get lucky with their mat not being smelly but not this gal. Also, circuit boxing has tested this mat pretty well. There's some wear already but overall it's holding up."
273,Tim,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got this largely because it is longer than most standard sized mats (I am 6'0"" and usually just barely fit on these mats).  This one gives a few inches extra length, so it fits better.  I have noticed that is does slide much more than my last one when doing sit-ups - it creeps 6-8 inches across carpeted floor over the 150 reps, when my old one only moved about half as far.  It is comfortable and provides nice amount of padding.  The worst part is that it smells pretty bad - I have been using for almost 3 months and it still smells."
274,Matthew Sullenberger,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice and comfortable mat, I like the extra padding when doing yoga on a hard surface to help with my knees. My only complaint is the mat is quite stretchy, e.g. when I am doing downward dog the the mat itself will stretch apart and cause my position to slide a bit. I'll keep using it but wish it didn't stretch out.The funky smell went away in a few days."
275,BackpackerBravo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Pro:  Nice thickness for high impact workout  Price is lowerCon:  Thick is good but material not dense  Therefore stability leg work is hard  Length wise the may stretches few cm  Stretch then contract ...  If you get sweaty ... Easy to slip or loose footing  on aerobics/yoga ...  Happended a few time so I place one of my  Older mat on top for safety  Did not have the weave/dimple checkerboard  pattern that helps with traction
276,shopfreq,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this to take virtual yoga classes at home. I also bought this because it's cheap and I knew I'd get it in a reasonable timeframe. The mat is thick and soft. The mat also has a weird fishy rubber smell that goes away after a few weeks. The absorbency is undesirable as sweat and lotion make the surface of this mat slippery - recommend using a mat towel. For what it is and how much it costs, it has served its purpose for home use. I would not recommend this for any yoga outside of your private home or for extended practices."
277,Annie,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  One thing i dont like about this item is that the mat is to long so for a little room it kinda doesnt fit well. The thing I like about this thing is that it pervent the floor getting dearty so that is very good but i just think it should not be so long
278,KM,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I ordered two of these and both arrived with such an incredibly horrendous smell! I have now left them in the open to air out for a week - they still smell awful! It is really too bad because the thickness is great. I am not sure I can even use either with how bad they smell and will certainly not be able to keep them in my house or car.
279,Emily,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I enjoy using this yoga mat. It's long, thick, and comfortable. Easy to roll up and store away in my closet. There's just one issue... it stinks! It has a strong odor of rubber/plastic, even after cleaning it multiple times. I like to do some of my exercises outside and the sun makes the smell even worse! The smell is so bad I would have reconsidered buying another mat if I had known."
280,Krramnik,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not good for serious yoga. 12.5mm thickness is too much. 5mm to 6mm would be ideal. This is very spongy and I found it very difficult to balance my self while doing many standing postures like warrior pose, tree pose etc.,It might be good for savasana . That too I am not entirely sure. Even my yoga teacher said I should get something thinner looking at me struggling with some poses. Finally I got myself another cork mat of 6mm thickness and that feels great."
281,forevercascade,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the color (purple) and thickness of this mat.  I exercise barefooted most of the time and enjoy the cushiness of the mat.  However, I used it on hardwood floors and it is very slippy.  I have used an older mat underneath it to keep it from slipping on the floor.  The mat is also very stretchy.  I can feel it move underneath me when I step back into plank or down dog.  This was also better when I used a mat underneath.  I like the thickness of the mat and the extra length.  I am not sorry I bought it, but I have moved on to another mat for yoga."
282,CrisPyKnowsBest,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using this yoga mat for about three weeks, and I use it mainly to pad my hands and knees during my workout. Upon receiving it, I noticed the cut of the mat wasn't straight but it doesn't bother me too much. I like that it's thick, my knees and hands/wrists feel supported. However, I've already began to notice that the mat is ripping in some areas. Kind of disappointing considering I don't stretch the mat during the exercises."
283,Hawaii Bound,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Thickness good!  Long is good!  Ribbed design is ok (not really necessary). BUT the narrow width is BAD.  Narrower than most other mats, you'll fall off the sides, and need to move to the center repeatedly.  I usually buy the Harbinger mat which is wider and a better quality.  But I'm away from home and just needed a quick ship cheap mat to fill in.  It's fine for the price, but I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again."
284,Sarah B.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Thick and cushy, but not super durable. My hubby does push-ups with his fists down, and the material is coming apart in the spots where his fists are placed.  Also, as said by many others, the smell is strong and not very pleasant. Smells kinda like sulfer. Washing in washing machine seemed to make the smell stronger? Well you get what you pay for. Good price."
285,rosslink,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  appears to stain from sweat and retains indentations from use, like where shoes have been. Size is slightly too narrow but long enough for me being 5' 9"". Would not buy again."
286,Pako,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this one to work out at home, it is ok if you're doing certain abs work out, but for doing push ups or planking might not be the best option, it expands like a rubber band so I feel like I either will break it or I will slip and hurt myself.I like the thickness, when I'm doing abs I don't feel the hardness of the floor"
287,Lena,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Omg.... this thing stinks so bad. I mean it smells like dead fish stew or something. It does come with the strap and it is nice and thick and feels good under my feet. Love the length and everything about it except for the fact that the smell is horrendous. Hopefully airing it out works but I really don't know.
288,Moriah,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like that it is so comfortable on my joints (my wrist hurts like hell on a regular yoga mat), and I never noticed a smell so I guess I’m one of the lucky ones there. However, I am not a fan of how stretchy it is...it’s impossible to even stand in a warrior pose without this thing overextending and tearing a little. I’ve had it a month and it now has permanent ripples on the surface from stretching. I’ve had other 1/2 inch mats that never had that problem. Buuuut my dog ate that one. So here we are."
289,NimaH,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I've had this mat for almost a month now (bought two for my wife and I) and am pretty happy with it. There are some issues though: they are narrower than most of the other mats. They are also slippery on parquet flooring and it's really hard for me and my wife to workout in the living room where we both fit.
290,Smee48,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is perfectly acceptable.  The bands to hold it together are disappointing.  The first one broke the first time I unrolled the mat.  The second broke the second time I used the mat.  I tied them together in a makeshift way in order to hold it rolled up until I can sew a solution, but that didn't work either.  The whole thing is just chunks of straps now."
291,Shay,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I use this mat to do stretches, I have only used it 4 time, and there is already rips and cracks in the mat!The mat is comfortable, but should not already have rips in the mat after 4 uses.  I would not recommend this mat , it is cheaply made and does not last at all."
292,Annie Dee,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a good quality mat overall, and you cannot beat the price. However, it's not ideal for a yoga practice, which is what I bought it for. It's so thick that it makes balancing very difficult, which can easily throw you out of your practice mentally and physically—and even landed me on the floor a few times. (Luckily, my falls were very cushioned!) The mat can also be a little slippery if you sweat a fair bit. It's held up well to six months of weekly yoga practice—very little wear and tear are visible—but I'm not sure how it would hold up with a more intense exercise regimen.Points docked for being too thick for desired (and advertised) use and slipperiness."
293,Olufemi Williams,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like how comfy the product is, but it does not seem to me like it is an exercise mat. It looks more as if it is suitable to be a rug which I use it for. The smell is terrible and it takes up most of the scents in the room and I have to put it in my closet, but the closet is smelling like the exercise mat. That is the only problem that I have with the mat. The top and bottom part of the mat rolls up and does not lay down flat and it curls up to much. It gets dirty and smudgy quickly. This is like a blanket on a cold winter night for a homeless person. $19.00 more like 0.1 cents."
294,shoremama,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very nice exercise mat. However it is NOT as described and varies from the photo. I’m taking off two stars for false advertising. There was NOT a carrying handle with elastic to hold the mat together and carry it somewhere. The mat arrived with a piece of thin plastic tape around it and once you remove that it’s not reusable.
295,Gustavo Rojas,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its very confortable for most of the yoga posture, but the chemical smell is very terrible, when you sweat it becomes worst!"
296,ajaac,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This was for my wife, she likes it fairly well, but it's stated to come with a strap, and that was the reason we chose this one.  I arrived on time without the strap so don't buy it if you are looking for the strap to carry it with."
297,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Uh ... The smell is horrible, kind of toxic rubber smell ... but I think it will fade away after a few days.Other than that - It is pretty comfort.Durability - I don't think it is gonna last for long. Will update.Last but not least -  it did NOT came with ""Carrying Strap"" as described, I have not contacted Amazon regarding that, I can keep it as is because I don't have to carry it around so often."
298,Dean,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought it because I'm 300 lbs and wanted something to better protect my knees. It works, but since it's squishy, it makes it hard to balance. Like trying to stand on your bed. Not that bad, but you get the idea. I can feel it in my wrists during down dog too. It works, but keep those things in mind. It's also wearing down after 3 months of use, but I am heavy."
299,JGr,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Comfy? Yes. Size of a yoga mat? Yes. Taut like a yoga mat? Nope, it flexes and stretches too easily. Also already noticing some marks on the mat after roughly 10 yoga sessions.The yoga mat isn’t taut, so your downward facing dog and every movement will have some awkward balance/stability issues since this mat just shouldn’t be used for yoga."
300,Marygoooround,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  its thick so very comfortable and doesn't break easily been using this for months almost everyday for my hot pilates class BUT 3 STARS coz this mat doesn't stay in place it keeps sliding around i almost fell most of the time and stability is important coz i moved a lot in our pilates class
301,Meg M,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is okay and just that. It easily rips or leaves marks....I have marks that won’t go away just from the carrying strap alone. The mat slips when I go to do certain stretches and my foot gets stuck weather I have socks on or not. Wouldn’t exactly recommend.
302,SM,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a very basic mat. It has a lot of stretch to it which is not conducive to good yoga form. It is also not a hot yoga mat as it slips and is very slippery with any moisture.
303,Lyndsay Johnson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is pretty good for the price you pay but I was pretty disappointed to see that I had a hug slash through mine when I got it. I didn’t want to go through the process of returning it and waiting for a new one when I needed to use it immediately but I am disappointed. Other than that, the mat works out just fine. It’s easy to clean and relatively comfortable. I’ve been using it for a while now and the only downside to daily use is you can start to see where the mat is wearing. For example, when I do planks you can see where my elbows were located."
304,OriyaGuru,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat arrived in good packaging. But looks like the product missed quality check. The brand new mat already has extreme fold marks and have small tears.I am disappointed with this amazon basic mat.
305,Marissa Bennett,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just opened up this mat to use. It’s super comfortable however as soon as I unrolled it there were several tears and scratches in it. I purchased this brand new and it has yet to be out of the packaging until now. Very disappointed that I received a damaged product and I’m stuck with it due to being unable to send it back anytime soon. Make sure you thoroughly check it over when you open it. It’s very soft and the perfect amount of cushion, but I worry about durability given the damage present before I even opened it"
306,Kimberly M.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would give it 3 1/2, the smell is horrid. Opened box and the fishy smell was crazy strong, took matts out of plastic wrap and put them in the garage for a week. After a week I used palmolive soap to wash it and there was pink ink on the rag. errr...I don't want pink ink on my clothes when I work out"
307,VPH,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat arrived in good shape and is quick thick and comfy on hard surfaces. However, I find it to be much too thick and slippery for yoga. Even with me being a 230lb man, my weight did not compress the foam enough to be able to balance properly, and the bottom slides on wood flooring. Great for things like sit-ups and other floor exercises."
308,Suz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  the light is not very bright, its a little larger than the previous ones i had, but the light is not as good considering you have to use so many batteries. and the end cap over the button fell off after very little use, poorly constructed."
309,Isaac,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm a big guy, so I might have overestimated the size and practicality of this mat... was hoping to do some light workouts on it (pushups, situps, etc) and found myself in more pain than just being on the floor. Ended up tossing this and buying folding mats. YMMV"
310,Nathan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using this mat daily for a bit more than a month now for bodyweight and other aerobic exercises as I have hardwood floors.  Pretty rapidly, it started developing pitting and pockmarks across most of its surface.  Given the price, I'm not too concerned, but if you're looking for something that will last a bit longer, consider paying a bit more for a better product."
311,AJ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just got this yesterday.  While I'm sure it will be a welcome addition to the home gym, it did not arrive with a carrying strap as advertised.  Fair warning.  It is long, and nice and thick, but does have a strange smell upon arrival."
312,Justin Dalton,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I really should let my wife do most of the reviews since she gets a lot more use out of our workout Equiptment than I do. This comes at a great price but still feels thin and is damaged pretty easily. Maybe look into paying more for something a bit more durable.
313,Charlotte,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Happy for the mat but it did not come with a carrying strap as advertised. I am trying to figure out how to contact the seller but there’s no option to do so or it’s hidden somewhere and i can’t find it. I’m disappointed in that. Otherwise it’s a fine choice. I hate to send it back but need the carrying strap.
314,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  You get what you pay for. While this mat is nice for the extra cushion, it is NOT a good mat for yoga!! When I purchased it, my intention was to use it for yoga class (rookie mistake). You will slip and slide no matter how clean your hands and feet are.Overall, depending on your intentions for use, it’s not a terrible mat (although it is hard to unroll and stay flat). Just don’t use it for yoga! Invest in a quality RUBBER mat for the best results I. Your practice."
315,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kind of disappointed, since the matt itself is comfortable and really long, but without the strap, it's bulky and hard to transport (it doesn't stay closed). I don't feel comfortable returning it due to COVID-19 and safety, so I guess I'm just going to need to make my own straps. Not a big deal, just not what I ordered."
316,Erika,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Received it today. There was a weird smell to it once I took the plastic off of it. And once that was done I saw that it was a little dirty around the edge. Not a big deal but you do expect it to be clean when it's a new product. The mat itself is very long and padded. Overall I'm pleased with the product.
317,Gracie Meyers,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This mat is very comfortable due to its length and thickness. I don’t think that it will last very long though because I unrolled it to smooth it out and my dog ran across it which left puncture marks in the foam. I definitely would not use this with shoes on and the jury is still out on whether this was a worthwhile purchase.
318,ADubs,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great cushioning, but this thing slides around like crazy. I’m constantly readjusting throughout the workout. The material is pretty foamy and retains indentations. Feels and looks cheap, but it protects my knees when working out on hard surfaces, so I suppose it still does the job."
319,Lisa L Hom,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was really pleased with the quality and the color of this thick yoga mat from Amazon Basics.  But I was disappointed in the carrying strap that was advertised and included.  The strap is composed of 2 elastic bands that are cheap and hard to wrap around the ends of the mat.  It will definitely break in a couple weeks.Amazon buyer / product sourcing - can you please spend the extra 50 cents to sew on velcro so that the strap can be attached easily?  Otherwise, don't even include it because it is so disappointing and frustrating to receive something like that when you advertise and show it in the listing."
320,M B,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  it is actually a okay mat. very comfortable and have good thickness. but have a very very distinct industrial rubbery smell that i can't get rid of. the elastic strap leaves marks. not completely excited about that!
321,Lisa V from New Jersey,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  While the mat provides a great cushion, it smell terrible.  The smell was so strong, that my husband noticed it from another room, so I put the mat outside for a few days.  Now you can only smell the mat from about 5 feet.  I bought the mat for yoga, and I need to cover it with towels to be comfortable putting my face near it because of the smell.  Also, the mat is starting to come apart after a few months.  There are parts that are rubbed away even though I only use the mat for 1-2 hours each week."
322,Jim S,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s fine for the price.  But it is a very cheap mat that doesn’t provide good cushioning as you sink right through it and just feals cheap.  But for the price its ok.
323,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Didn’t come with the carrying strap as advertised so I’m returning. It’s probably great for yoga inside. Unfortunately I needed it for outside cross training and it’s way too ‘squishy’ to be durable for that purpose.
324,Alyssa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I love this mat. It has been through a lot of the Chole Ting workouts with me. My only problem is it has worn down a lot but I am going to use it till I lose it.
325,Cmarie619,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Did not come with the strap as advertised. I double checked that it was in fact listed to have the strap, but that was missing. Also had a weird smell like some other reviews mentioned but it went away on its own pretty quickly."
326,Shawna Schuler,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Opened the box to a gouge in the mat. It is thick and soft but super soft, as in not durable. Havent used it yet, so we shall see how it holds up. Did come with a strap, but still not impressed so far if its damaged already."
327,raee.h,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm not sure how to contact someone but I never received the carrying strap that the description says comes with it. The mat is thick and comfortable for meditation but the whole reason I went with the mat was because it came with the carrying strap and it didn't include it.
328,Tate,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat is very comfortable but you exchange stability for comfort. It is a good mat for ab work but I wouldn’t recommend for yoga
329,Marisela Garcia,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This mat provides great cushion and feels very comfortable if you’re doing exercises that require you to be on your knees. It is easy to wipe and maintain clean. My biggest gripe and the only reason I had to stop using it was because it has an awful plastic like smell that permeated all my clothing. It penetrates your clothes so badly that the smell will penetrate an entire small room or even your laundry hamper.
330,SerafinaPekkala,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super thick but slippery.  It’s terrific for on ground core work and cushioning for cardio.  But any kind of standing exercises and I find myself slipping, even with shoes"
331,Scott M,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using the mat for about 2 weeks doing aerobic exercise that involves a lot of hopping and running in place (HIIT).  The mat is noticeably deformed and compressed in the area where my feet impact the mat.  It already needs to be replaced.  My previous mat was from Target.  It cost twice as much, but it took over 4 months to wear out.  The Amazon mat is a full 1/2"" thick with a nice soft texture, so it would probably be good for yoga or other non-impact activities."
332,helene wilson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It doesn't matter how thick or comfortable or stable this mat is, i can't get close enough to use it! The smell is awful n nauseating! It's been hanging out back for 3weeks straight and the smell is a lil less then when I took the plastic covering off."
333,A. Camien,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I was gratified to get this mat. What I laughed at was the mat holder that was included. It doesn’t come anywhere near big enough to use with the mat. I have another mat that where I may use it.
334,Jon Williquette,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not a huge fan. Amazon tapped it in the rolled form with something like packing tape. I couldn’t remove the tap with tearing the foam pad. Now the pad has two big rips from the tape that used to hold it together.
335,EGC,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Lots of comfort, especially for knees, wrists, and lower back. Added challenge for balance poses. However it slipped and didn’t hold its shape for warrior poses or lunges, making it an injury risk."
336,Gaston,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s soft but the smell is really bad!! My dog has pinched holes in it just from walking on it. The smell doesn’t fade away after weeks of using it.
337,Haoyuan Wang,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the texture. Not too soft not too hard. It also has a proper thickness.The only thing that I don’t like is its smell. When I did the child’s post on this mat, I can smell a pretty strong chemical scent. Not sure at this time if this scent will go away eventually."
338,Christina Izzo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Does the job but it's a very light mat. I want more wieght to hold down my mat. Spend a lot of time moving it back to place. Also tears easily if you push too hard with your toes or fingers. Will probably not purchase again.
339,Ariel,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a nice mat if you don’t have pets. My dog walked across it one time and created several puncture marks. I do really like the thickness of it, but I don’t think it is going to hold up well"
340,TANYA,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you're interested in the structural integrity of the mat (which most are), I'd pass on this cheaper deal. It scrapes, scuffs and gets damaged easily -- even with the carrying strap. Bummer. But it works overall so it serves its purpose well. It just gets ugly quickly."
341,Sue O,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I subtracted stars because my mat arrived without the carrying strap.  If that feature is important to you, don’t order.  I don’t plan to take mine out of my house, so that isn’t a deal-breaker.  But it is false advertising and should be addressed. The mat itself seems like a good one."
342,Scuff,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s fine. It’s a mat. It provides good comfort for home gym. Mine was also missing the carrying strap which is irritating.
343,Sarah,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I was looking for a thick yoga mat and I got what I was looking for... I just don't think it will last very long.
344,Yvonne,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm hoping after more use that the annoying squeaking will subside. I like that it is a thicker pad than some others. I like the carrying band.
345,Harry W.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is okay, nothing great. Very slippery if sweats drips onto it but very nice for the lower back and knees. It also does not really stick to hard wood floors, but works fine on carpet. Worth the money I guess, but nothing to write home about. Also, does not do well against Rottweilers! :D"
346,alba,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used max 15 times it’s soft but when you put your elbows and knees goes down quickly and it feels like your are on the floor and is  wrinkle like 130 years old human, I’m sorry I’m not happy with."
347,maria sandoval,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was under the impression it came with the black strap to keep it together, it did not!!! Really upset about that. It’s a hassle carrying it around."
348,wacoed,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Use it for planks, bears, birdogs, clamshells etc. on gym off days. When doing planks it does stretch quite a bit. We shall see if after time it starts to lose its shape or tears. For other excersizes it does provide enough padding. Use it on a tile floor. If it does break down will have to look for a more durable solution."
349,Humay,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Yes. exactly... I think this is my second worst amazon order. You can get better ones)))
350,Daniel Griffin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good padding for sitting stretches, sit-ups or push-ups. Would NOT use for yoga or much movement as it slides and folds if you slide your feet or hands on it."
351,Ashley,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This item is really thick. However, the edges are already looking like there is wear after 2 uses. It's also super hard to store and roll up because of the thickness. I guess if you are keeping out in your home, but if you want to travel with this or store in an apt, it's not very useful."
352,KarenC,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was disappointed - I expected it to be a little ""cushier"" - it's much stiffer than I was looking for."
353,Paul,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  slips around a bit and did make a rip and indentations after first couple of uses. Comfortable to lay on
354,Dr. Rachel Eliz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is narrow , I enjoy it. The length is good but I'm not tall. Make sure you read dimensions before purchase"
355,brandi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice thick mat.  It does move while I’m trying to use it on our hardwood floors.  I agree with other reviews that it does have a smell.  I let it air out outside and cleaned it numerous times with Lysol wipes but still has that smell.
356,Jenn,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Gets the job done. I’d give it four stars if not for the fact that the “carrying strap” is little more than flimsy pieces of elastic barely help together by a few stitches. It came apart the first time I tried to use it to carry the mat. Kind of disappointing considering I chose this mat over other cheaper models precisely because it came with a carrying strap. As for the smell reported by other buyers, it’s not bad at all. It’s not odorless, but it’s not at all overwhelming."
357,Jaclyn Golda,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good mat, maybe a little on the cheaper side but it serves its purpose. However, it did NOT come with a carrying strap as advertised."
358,Kolea777,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It is on the soft side for exercise mats. After a month of use I can see some abrasion. I think it will last about 6 months.
359,Kathryn,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Smells really bad. I've had this thing for months now and it still stinks up close.The thickness and colors are perfect, I just can't get past the chemical smell. Maybe in another couple months I'll start taking it to the gym with me."
360,Amy Starr,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pretty much the most basic yoga mat I've ever seen.I don't love it, but it's functional."
361,Kimi 45,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sturdy, large mat, however, the oder is strong and hasn't dissipated after 2 weeks."
362,K Morgan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this one for the thickness and value for the money. It seems a little weak and prone to damage although mine has seen little exposure/use. Comfortable though and the carry strap is very helpful even for storage.
363,KAT,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It didn't come with the carry strap as shown and the printing is almost worn off. But it works and my daughter didn't mention the lack of the strap and condition of the mat until it was too late to do anything about.
364,floatablehen52 ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I love the size and the thickness of the mat only problem is the odor because it smells like that dry fish food and I've aired it out for weeks before use. I had it since Xmas and the odor is still noticeable. I can use the mat though it's not overpowering but I'm on the mat so I notice of course.
365,Brittany F.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Great length and cushion however it sort of smells like fish.
366,99MB 320E 4matic,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A ok exercise mat. I’m a bit disappointed that it is starting to chip after about 6 weeks of hard use. I do use it every day for about 2 hours.
367,Jennifer L.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This seems like a great mat, but like others have said, it came with no strap.  The box even states, “with strap”.  So it’s clearly a mistake, but it’s a bummer."
368,Brumen ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good quality, unfortunately it's too thin."
369,Rachel L,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is cheap, so I guess I shouldn't really complain...but I used it ONCE (!!) to do yoga and it's already showing signs of wear-and-tear."
370,Amita Kour,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I placed the order, it was for the mat with a carrying strap. I took a screenshot of my order. I received it without the carrying strap. Now, when I click on my orders through Amazon, it just takes me to the listing without the strap. It is quite deceptive of Amazon."
371,Jonny5,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very comfortable for doing sit-ups and the like, but I have tears from my shoes after only two uses.  I guess you shouldn't wear shoes?"
372,Benjamin D.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  basic yoga mat, but didnt come with strap."
373,Nikhil Rajguru,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It moves around lil during use. It has distinct chemical smell. Otherwise, the sponge is thick."
374,iLove,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is soft and thick, but it does not come with the carrying strap which is misleading. I would've bought a similar one for a couple dollars more had I known."
375,thomas burdg,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Its long enough but not thick. I have other mats a little thicker. This one is hard but does move with knee or hands placed on it with pressure
376,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Read carefully and ignore the picture. There is NO STRAP with this item. The foam feels very cheap. I will update the review once I have used this for awhile. Length is as advertised.
377,Angelica Holt,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I like this mat.  I feel like it’s a good size & thickness.  The reason I’m giving it 3 stars instead of 5 is because it arrived with a little damage.
378,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a very comfortable mat, but it can slip on smooth floors in you don't move carefully.  I tried flipping it over and putting the ribs down, but then my feet slipped on the mat.  When going to class, I like to roll up my towel inside, but if I do that, the straps don't fit around it.  I am giving a mid-range score because I can work around those issues, but it really would be nice to have a more textured base to prevent slipping."
379,Steve Leege,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice but I expected that it would be more firm
380,AngelKake,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I used this today and loved it.  The problem is that mine didn't come with a carrying strap!
381,AshLeeAnn,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  We love our mat, but you must air out for a few days, as it smells horrible at first."
382,zelda,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Shoes will rip this material.
383,Jeremy,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It’s alright. I ordered the grey one but they sent me the green one. I’m not that upset because it’s still the same product. Also though, this thing smells like straight cat pee. The odor is awful for the first 48-72 hours you own it. So I recommend cleaning it and letting it dry out outside. Other than that it’s okay."
384,Erika Gutierrez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Did not come with a strap as advertised in the picture. That is what I was looking for and no strap. the thickness is great for extra cushion.
385,Nela Raos,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  One week in and it already has holes and you can see spots of wear on multiple areas of the mat. Dissapointing as this is just from 6 yoga workouts
386,Knoblin Goblin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Like it really smells like a plasticy fish smell. It also does not seem like it will last long. It is showing sign of wear and ive only used it a little. But it is very soft and cushy
387,Paul Williams,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I returned this item because I was looking for a wider mat.
388,Babbs,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I like this mat but it is not ideal for Vinyasa yoga or Ashtanga. It is best for Hatha or simple stretching.
389,Nailin Ping,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  As it advertised, this mat is on the thick side comparing to other yoga mats. Feel comfortable doing workout on it. However, the quality is not the best. It easily got scratched and I started to see little holes on the mat after one month's use."
390,T. Brooks,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't think it's going to last too long--first use and you can see imprints of hands and feet.  It's nice and cushiony like I wanted, but not very good quality."
391,P Daily,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is, for lack of a better word, THICK. When I read 1/2 inch I was not expecting to receive such a bulky large mat. However, it does great for home yoga and floor exercise, but I don't foresee myself lugging to class."
392,RJ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a lightweight and thick mat. But makes squeaky sounds sometimes when doing exercises.
393,Pressy sankaran,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Delivery: greatProduct: sweat on this thing at your own peril, you’ve purchased a slip n slide. Will start tearing after use for HIIT training"
394,Juan G.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Recently broke my old mat that I got from Walmart. Got this one as a replacement. It is not ant Pro Mat Manduka but does it's job relatively well.
395,Bethany Austin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat itself is great.  The strap that came with it broke the very first time I tried to use it.  Now I have to order a separate carrying strap for it.
396,john kares,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Forme matt
397,Cleve,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very soft but way to easy to tear apart when doing poses like downward dog on.
398,Morgan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mat works great, did not come with carrying strap..."
399,Valerie Kirkwood,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s pretty think so harder to roll up. Also it gets pits in it rather easily. Very cushiony and comfy. I like it. The strap is a must. Don’t lose it.
400,Buzzing Bee,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s nice but it is very thick and difficult to carry around and store not like most yoga mats.
401,Nicole,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat arrived and it smelled horrible!  Sprayed febreeze and wiped it down with bleach and nothing worked!  I wanted something with width for yoga not length but I kept because I didn't feel like returning it.
402,75 South,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This item did not come with the carrying strap.  I am very disappointed did not get the complete item that was pictured.
403,Ben,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This yoga mat extends out too much. I would prefer a firmer and a stretchy one.
404,Ginny H.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Too thick for stances.
405,Sarah,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very comfortable mat, my only complaint is that when used on hardwood it’s very noisy which can be troublesome when in a quiet yoga class!"
406,scott,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Matt had a very unpleasant odor when it arrived, had to air out for three days before use. Could still smell for about a week. Not as noticeable now. Comfortable to use overall."
407,mjtrahar64,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  too thin for comfort
408,Topher,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very soft. Great for low intensity yoga. Unfortunately it slides around with any movement and stretches too much with wide leg poses such as warrior. Not appropriate for fitness classes. Acceptable for hard yoga classes. Perfect for low intensity yoga.
409,Tracey McManus,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  My matt did not come with a strap even though it says it in the description.  It is very thick and provides lots of cushion.
410,Megan Kosiba,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Seems flimsy and not durable. Time will tell. Love the color and its squishy on my feet.
411,Maki,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the mat very much, the strap that comes with it not really, the straps are flimsy and unpractical."
412,Linell McWilliams,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Did not like mat for Yoga classes. Mat slipped and made a squeaky sound when moving into yoga positions.very distracting.
413,Summer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very easy to scratch or peel the top off. I didn't even know how it happened. Third use I saw a little patch is peeled off.
414,Amani Jay,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat itself is great and is as described. I bought it for floor exercises and it does the job. It comes with a carrying strap but mine came broken and frayed, hence the three stars."
415,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s very thick and comfortable which I like! However it doesn’t really grip to a surface that good. If I’m doing a workout sometimes it begins to slide. But overall it’s not bad
416,Anna,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The only thing that I didn't like about this mat is that when I had removed the plastic it had a strong chemical odor but I figured this will air out which it did. However, I had noticed a large scratch on the smooth side of mat. This probably happen during production but wonder if this could of be sold to indicate slight defects. Keep in mind that this is not quality control with this mat and may have scratches."
417,Atheer K,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I mean, it works. Smelled wierd for a day. Thickness is decent. Oddly thin and extra long."
418,Regina King,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s okay for the money you spend but not top quality
419,Raven Root,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Seems like a good product but came dirty already inside the package. Not sure what that’s about?
420,Evi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Soft, big but SLIPS!!! I have to use weights to keep it in place- I find this to be of better quality than some of the higher end brands"
421,R. Schlaeger,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I'm a bit bummed with this one. I had the orange so I thought I would get another one. But this one kept tearing.  Annoying.
422,Darlene,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  There was a scratch on mine when I unboxed it. The mat is a good length and it is comfortable and soft.
423,Stacy Black,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It’ll do the trick (for a while).  But, had it for 3 months and looking for a new one.  Doesn’t roll out to lay as flat as you would want, but good for the price."
424,Erica N.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This May moves pretty easily on tile or laminate floor. Not much grip.
425,Captain Obvious,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super soft and perfect length (I'm tall) , however, it started getting little tears and rips very quickly"
426,potter,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Thick and absorbs weight off knees. However, this is very slippery when doing  any downward dog type poses. Almost slipped off mat a few times."
427,Melissa ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s more of a mat than yoga mat
428,Wayne Burnop,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Got a mat by itself.  Wife likes thickness and color but no carrying strap is not happy and I can’t find a way to contact the seller.
429,John Fiddler,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Didn’t get the strap.
430,Laura B,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just got this and haven't used it yet, but dear god the smell is atrocious!  I was expecting maybe a petroleum kind of smell, but this thing smells like dead fish.  It's bad.  Really bad."
431,yk,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's thick but not sturdy. But quite good quality for the price.Just another amazon basic thing...
432,Helson Taveras,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is not good for hot yoga! You will slip and fall. Doesn’t hold up to the sweat well and makes weird squishy sounds when soaked.
433,MKSimmons,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat arrived quick and looks just like the photos. When it arrived it had a small poke hole, nothing major so I ignored it. I’ve since used it 3 times during my hour long workouts. It has began to visibly wear down. This is definitely not a mat that’ll last."
434,eddie  rodriguez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is very  soft, great for yoga or any stretch workout but with weights, if start to tear!"
435,J. Lundy,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Came on time, works well, no strap.  Don't put it in the title if it's not there."
436,John S. Holderness,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Likes - good thick pad, good size and color, good price.Dislikes - smells like a cat urinated on it.  Not pleasant."
437,Meredith Sprovier,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat showed up today and much to my disappointment it does NOT come with the carrying strap even though it says and shows it does.  Mat is of good size and thickness just upset about the strap.
438,amruta giri,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It does wear off pretty fast but i like how thick it is.
439,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s soft but so soft that your shoes rip it apart just my moving on it
440,ALO,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  very soft and very supportive for standing on day one of use. also larger than my other mats.definitely a chemical smell when it comes out of the bag; seems to be gone quickly though but how far gone i cannot tell; i don't feel comfortable breathing near the mat without knowing what it's actually made of and I don't know about you but I tend to breathe a lot when I'm near my yoga mat exercising.i bought one for exercise and one to replace another yoga mat i've been standing on for years while working; more specifically i was going to buy one that said it is tpe but turns out they didn't have that one anymore between adding to cart and actually checking out; so ended up jumping at the chance for a couple of these without noticing origin of these is not identified nor is it exactly identified what they are made of. i've heard of foam but what foam? and what about the coating?anyway, it sticks to my feet big time while standing and working at computer; have to pull feet away; also makes noise when doing exercise where legs stretch and may slide a bit such as burpees and downward dog. what is it that makes them stick to my feet; looks like they have a bit of a sheen.Obviously I won't be eating these directly but do I need to keep my hands away from my mouth during use and wash hands after touching these? Is it okay to breathe as I do my vinasas?rating would go up if i knew not toxic to ingestion by mouth (by mat to hand to mouth, for example) and by inhalation of whatever particles it emits. also if not so sticky but needs to retain some stickiness in order to be useful for yoga.just my experience, observations and thoughts for your reference; your mileage may vary.edit: forgot to mention straps; as someone else mentioned, they are very elastic; doesn't seem possible they could last; i would prefer they be made out of same material as the ""handle"" part of the strap which is much more durable but might be harder to slide on/off."
441,KW,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Ok
442,Yes,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s a really nice mat I’ve sat on some way thinner than this so I’d consider it thick not extra thick my last mat must have been an inch thick or something when I saw extra thick I bought it hoping it was like my last mat but it wasn’t. So it was good but not extra thick.
443,Julia,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Arrive damaged from shipping.  Could do a better job packaging it.  Slides on non carpeted floors.  I like the thickness of the mat, but overall not so satisfied with the product."
444,Priya,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good thickness and it's quite long. But it's not that wide.
445,J. Bart,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good length,  but needs to be a little Wider"
446,Sally Schaeffer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat itself is fine but it didn’t come with a carrying strap.  Not a problem now as we are all at home, but it was a feature that was a selling point for this mat."
447,Cynthia Hobbs,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice and thick but scratched and dents way too easy
448,EG,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Comfortably thick.  After a few months, it is starting to wear down."
449,Claire Whitehead,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It feels nice under my feet, but it tears verrrryyyy easily. I’ve only had it a week and have several small cuts in foam after only 5 uses."
450,Sarah Sapp,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great padding for workouts, but it slips. When using it, the mat stretches out."
451,amhovel,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Started to get chunks and scratches easily. This mat is very comfy but very thick for yoga. Would recommend for weights/stretching/core workouts but not yoga
452,Brett,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Has a weird smell that hasn't gone away weeks later. Otherwise a good mat.
453,LizLA,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought this to do sit ups. My tailbone still hurts. Need something thicker.
454,Avinash ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Quite soft, but seems weak. I would have preferred 6 inch wider."
455,APace,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It’s very soft, but slides and stretches during yoga sessions."
456,G. Sanders,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I love the mat however I am missing the straps.  Can someone please send me the straps?
457,SZ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This smells so bad still that I've resorted to just leaving it outside.
458,Grecia,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I just got my mat today, I was really excited until o realized that the sling is missing on my mat, how can I get it shipped? The description of the item states that is included."
459,Christie S.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Like the color (Purple).  It is soft and comfortable to use, however it mars easily and arrived with one end distorted.  I have kept it because it does not affect the functionality.  But even the carrying strap leaves indentations."
460,David,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This mat is too thick for yoga.
461,Zarena Cason,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great thickness, was quite sturdy. Had an overwhelmingly terrible smell once opened that quickly filled my living room after only being open for a few minutes."
462,Fiona Chen,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It doesn’t come with the strap that show on the picture so it has nothing to hold it when done.
463,CJ Reid,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good enough but has a weird smell.
464,cj,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Thick enough.  2 imperfections
465,Ashley Frentz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat itself is nice and thick, however it was damaged when I opened the box!!! I needed it today too. Such a bummer"
466,Sa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  My product came in on time. Perfectly as described but it smells like fish! Best yoga/ exercise mat out there for the best price just air it out for a week
467,Diane Porter,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I thought I was getting the same thing I ordered before. This one is a bit too hard to be comfortable for me.
468,Mark Calaway,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Within two uses I had tears and rips in my mat. It is very friable and tears up easily. So soft and cushy as well as nice and big but the quality is very low.
469,LM,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is great, but mine didn’t come with a strap. That was a big reason why I wanted this particular one. A little bummed about that."
470,Frank Hassle,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is nice and cushy, but there was no strap included."
471,Melly Mel,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kinda thin, oddly long. I was hoping for something a little more substantial. I'll wear it out in a year, but I break all my toys."
472,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Didn't get strap
473,brigette,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I really like this yoga mat but I could not find a strap it was supposed to come with in the box.  I'm hoping I can get one sent to me.
474,Joshua,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I found that the 1/2 inch mat has a lot of strech to it and slides. It makes some stances and positions difficult. I have a hardwood floor so maybe on a carpet it would be more stable.
475,Daniel S. Hudak,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a few months of use, and leaving it open to air out, it still has a prominent rubber smell.  It’s perfectly soft and comfy, but it’ll leave your clothes smelling like rubber, which I literally and figuratively find odious."
476,Cherry Mertens,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Very nice- loved color. Could be a little wider
477,Mandy Lin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Smells bad
478,Dana,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice may but did not come with strap as pictured.
479,Artak Z.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat looks fine so far.I bought it for my 3 y/o daughter and it’s very big and good size.However, this was supposed to have a strap which didn’t come with the mat.It’s hard to carry around without the strap."
480,CoolerGirl,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice exercise mat but mine arrived without the carrying strap. I took the box apart in case it was stuck inside but no joy. Otherwise very nice mat and I am keeping it anyway, but it would have been better with the strap as advertised."
481,Matthew&Sarah Shanor,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  That pad is great for working out. However the elastic carrying strap is complete junk. This one busted on the first day when the mat was rolled back up and I went to put the strap back over it.
482,Daveb382,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's an OK mat. My main problem with it is that it doesn't have much grip to it. I find that my hands slip on it more than they do with other mats. It is a pretty good exercise mat, but not so good for yoga."
483,Paige,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Thick and comfortable when new but the surface breaks down and started flattening with just a month of use not durable and the holder is just a thin strap of elastic
484,Dallas,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mat is thick & cushiony which I like but as a result of its bulk, the carrying strap it comes with does not work. Strap broke on the second time I went to use it. Better they not include a strap then include one of such poor quality."
485,Jeffrey Babitts,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This product did NOT come with the carrying strap as advertised. FYI
486,badawy,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  i would not  consider it the best choice in the market
487,Alicia Charles,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Way too long, not very thick."
488,Taylor,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is much narrower than I wanted. Also, shipping was awful. Mine came pretty beat up from shipping."
489,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Mat is soft and works great...did not come with the carrying strap it said came with it.
490,mafnap,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Had a smell and looked different than pictures
491,MIfan49265,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Too thick for yoga.  Will need to find another use for it.
492,Madhumita,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Did not come with shoulder strap as shown. I had to purchase separately.
493,Stephanie,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Thickness of the mat is great. I am just disappointed because the carrying strap is missing. I was not included with the mat.
494,Claudis,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It will do for home stretching but I wasn’t experiencing to use it for a real practice. Is great for that price though
495,Mark Holmgren,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It suffers permanent dents easily.
496,Monica Matous,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Carrying strap wasn’t included as stated on description.  I’ll keep mat if strap can be sent.
497,JB,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It functions well as a mat, but even after a month it continues to emit irritating, caustic fumes, like sulfurous plastic. This makes it difficult to exercise on it. Also, the cheap carrying strap broke after only a few weeks. I don't recommend it."
498,Aaron Wenzel,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is great for home exercise but I do not recommend for Yoga. The first time I tried it, I couldn't find my balance because of how thick and soft it was and during my second class my instructor advised me that it's not the best mat for practicing yoga and I would find myself struggling."
499,Traci,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Just received however the strap is ripped
0,Amazon Customer,Huge piece of foam,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Just a huge piece of foam.wears out on first use
1,Shaluu B.,Thickness is good as I wanted for my Yoga practice but I ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Thickness is good as I wanted for my Yoga practice but I can see holes in the mat where I stand and sit to do my Yoga in 2 days itself. Let's see how much longer it will last.
2,Sumit,The quality of the material is good but what good is quality of the material if ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This review is for those who want to buy this for the gym purposes.The quality of the material is good but what good is quality of the material if the mat slips. Is amazonbasics would have built it non slippery then it would be a perfect mat for exercising purpose
3,veronica,Not worth it! Lots of better mats available at better prices!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat has pungent smell and also it’s very foamy. Not good for any standing exercises as your feet will sink in and stability of body becomes difficult. Also the mat does not stay stuck to the floor, it keeps bulging once opened and tends to keep curling back during workout which is annoying. I usually need to place a weight on top of it for it to stay on the floor. Over all definitely not worth the price. After a week’s usage i can already see the small tears on the mat.For anyone looking for mats for regular workouts, (and not just Yoga) pls go for some other mat, a thinner and sturdier one.. not this."
4,Ananya,Not recommended for those with a regular yoga practice,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The only good thing about this yoga mat is its thickness and the padding it provides for the knees. Apart from that, the fabric is just not suitable for everyday practitioners. I've been using this mat for three months and here's why I wouldn't recommend it:1. The fabric is too fluffy. This might make the mat lightweight but it' a huge compromise on your stability when you practice - holding postures like high lunge, warrior 3, standing splits, tree, etc. will make you all wobbly as if you're on a feather mattress.2. Because of the airy fluffy fabric, it dents easily. So the spots where you stand the most of place your knee the most will become dented and wrinkly within days of using this mat, making the surface uneven and more unstable.3. The material is strangely stretchy, so if you're in plank or downward facing dog where your hands and feet are extending in opposite directions, the mat will weirdly stretch out. This is an extremely bizarre thing because you start off with your hands and feet exactly where they should be according to the posture but end up with them splaying out because your mat can't hold still!4. The floor-facing side of this mat has zero grip. In fact, it can change position at the slightest touch. It's like practicing yoga on Aladdin's flying carpet. You start in one spot of the room and - if you don't keep shimmying and wiggling in the middle of your practice to keep the mat in its place - you will end up in quite a different place by the time you finish practice, and not in a good way!"
5,Amazon Customer,Too flimsy-avoid !,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  At the first look, it looks nice and fluffy, but look at the pics- the indents are after 3 days of use !The mat has no structural strength and is very flimsy. Your footprints will be indented and I am already struggling with its quality. Not worth 1k, and avoid at all costs ! I would have returned but it hs been damaged so much after 3 classes of Yoga, I know they won't take it back."
6,Sibi,"Too cushiony and slippery, not durable.",2.0 out of 5 stars,  Too thick... not stable while doing single leg exercises and things like full side planks.The rubber started breaking within couple of days and sheds so much that I hardly use it anymore.  Also there may suddenly slips and turns your side lunges to full splits.I have an old Cosco Mat which is thinner but more comfortable and Stable. Not worth the price I spent on it.
7,Ssorabh,Good Quality BUT...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is good quality, soft, comfortable for the joints and looks durable.The major downside is that it doesn't grip the floor and stretches while doing yoga, so it's quite risky at times.I am almost 6 feet, so another shortcoming is that it falls short in length and width for guys. I wish another variant in 7feet x 3feet was available."
8,Kiran,"It's not of rubber, just plastic sponge.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's not so comfort for yoga, the softness is more than what is needed, so while doing yoga we feel that we're not study on  floor ie we feel unbalanced.Also not stable on floor, it is slippery.Durability also very less it's very delicate."
9,Dev,"No grip , no strength",2.0 out of 5 stars,  Would suggest not to buy this if you are looking for a proper yoga with grip and strength. Softness is the only thing that it offers . There no grip . While stretching the mat also stretches makes it difficult to retain a pose . Specially for asanas like the warriors pose .
10,Shalini A.,Very Slippery. Not safe,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's soft , cushiony but very slippery n already started chipping after using just for a few times. Caution, don't place it directly on the floor, you might end up falling bad and hurt yourself, its soooo slippery.Use it on a carpet only. Moreover, it would become more slippery if u sweat. So can use only for light exercise. I am not using it now, as could get hurt badly , twice"
11,shylendra hegde,"very soft, but it gets damaged very easily",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  very soft it is a foam not durable, so it gets damaged very easily , it got damaged even by the band, to put on when not in use which came with  the product"
12,pooja,it's a bad product,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pro's1. Good thickness2. Soft3. AffordableCons1. slips all the time2. resilience is low3. stretches while doing doing yoga , which might result into accidentthis is not good for any active activity ... i bought this for Yoga and its quite useless... buying a better one now from Decathlon."
13,Ranjan Debnath,"Slippery Thick Sponge, not a yoga matt",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's just a thick sponge not a yoga matt, does not have grip at all, on top of that no swet absorption, so after 5-10 minutes of intense workout it will slip more.Not long lasting, after 1 month it started showing scratches."
14,Satheesh S. Rao,Two Stars,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not a great product.. After 2 days usage one can see marks.. Feels like a cheap product
15,Priya,Not a happy purchase,2.0 out of 5 stars,  For this price and brand I would definitely not expect the mat would slip. The thickness is very comfortable for Yoga otherwise wouldn't suggest this for other workouts
16,Aditya,Not worth the purchase.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  After a week of using it, I could see small fabric particles of the mat all over my body. Not only does it itch, it also makes it very uncomfortable to do any kind of activity on it. When you press on the mat, the area underneath flattens, thus hurting the palms, knees and feet. It slips easily on any kind of flooring. I would not suggest anybody to purchase this product."
17,123,Not for yoga.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is definitely not a mat for yoga . It keeps moving while doing yoga , so danger of losing your balance as its surface is not anti skid at all.Only good thing about this mat is that its lightweight."
18,sanchita garg,This product is super thick and skids too much on indoor surface.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was very disappointed to receive this product for its price. Simply put, it was a thick piece of foam and was super slippery. Totally unsuitable for indoor yoga or workout. This might work for someone who wants it for outdoor purposes and needs a thick supporting material on rough surfaces."
19,Aparajita Rastogi,It's foam mat not a yoga mat,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am very disappointed from the product as I didn't expect that a Amazon product may be of such a bad quality... It's foam, nothing else... Doesn't support well while practising yoga... Slippery as well..."
20,Vinay,Defective delivered,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The product was alright but came defective. But as it took a while to get delivered in this lockdown so I decided to not to return and use the defective only.
21,A.B.Sreya,Not worth for money.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The thickness and support are good. But as the mat is skidding during exercise, especially if we use it on the tile floor,  the very purpose of the Mat will be defeated.  The price is also a little high when compared to similar other Yoga mats. So think twice before you buy it."
22,Kevin,Too soft and spongy,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Too soft for yoga. No proper grip and slips/moves constantly. Difficult to do Surya namaskar on it.Two stars cause it's nice as a mattress and relaxing for savasana.
23,JanT,Design flaw,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This does not have Criss cross pattern, only vertical lines. So, when you are doing downward dog, your hands slide and slip on the mat. Very hard to do yoga because of this slipperiness. Other things are good but this is a deal breaker."
24,GOWDA,Not suitable for yoga,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat is too soft and thick  hence its difficult to perform standing poses. You tend to slip due to softness since trip to stand is very low.
25,Punita,Can be avoided,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The product quality is not gd. It's got cracks and depressions in 2-3 usages only.
26,Abir,No traction. Not recommended,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The exercise mat is thick but doesn't have any traction. Not recommended for floor exercises or yoga.
27,Crafty,Not worth the price.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s thick which is good thing but quality is not up to mark and after few Surya namaskars it has indentation marks and look bad. Not worth the price at all.
28,Arun Gupta,Soft but not effective for postures involving standing stretches.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat has a lot of cushion and is comfortable; however this product is not effective while doing standing stretches etc. as the mat tends to skid and will not offer a firm grip on the floor.  Is comfortable for meditation/sit-down postures.
29,JB.,No Grip,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Its noisy but spongy helps with pressure during yogaGood qualityHowever I don’t comfortable doing poses on this cause of lack of  gripIf you are use to flat mats I suggest you don’t buy this
30,Vineeta Mudgil,Spony and not durable.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Very much spongy. Not sure about durability. Tough to fold after usage.
31,Sandip Roy India,Lightweight but slippery,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The main problem with the mat is it is not anti skid at all. It slips and slides on any kind of smooth floor. So in fact it becomes dangerous if you do anything on it that requires any kind of jumping etc.
32,AC,Not a yoga mat really,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not suitable for yoga or most other exercises, keeps slipping and stretches in all directions!"
33,Relevant,The Material is detiorating and developing cracks in couple of months,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Cushioning effect is good, but it is not going to last."
34,Sushant Rana,"No grip, not suitable for yoga.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not suitable for doing yoga, there is no grip in the base, it keeps on slipping as you do yoga.Not suitable for yoga, only good for sleeping in the floor."
35,shailja,Not good for yoga,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The product is not good since it is very slippery and difficult to maintain balance on.
36,saurabh sharma,Definitely Not a workout mat,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Other than workout, it might be suitable for everything else. It stretches and slips when doing exercises like jacks or burpees. Go for TPE material rather than these foam mats"
37,VINAY DOSHI,Please buy according to your workout style,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Just used for 3 days and already there are tear marks on the mat. Its very disappointing that its an amazonbasics product and its durability is low.

117,Dumeo,It's comfortable when it's brand new,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's comfortable when it's brand new. The material feels good and the thickness  helps to avoid pain from contact with the hard floor. But just 2 days of push ups/planks later, I noticed this cracking on the surface under where my palms/knuckles are. Today (2nd day) I got a sensation similar to rug burn on my knuckles from just about 3 minutes of planking."
118,Anupreeta,"Though the quality is good, it's not anti-skid",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Though the quality is good, it's not anti-skid, defeating the usage, It's so smooth on the bottom side that if you have got ceramic tiles, which is common now-a-days, it slips."
119,ashutom,Material of the mat is not good,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have this mat : "" Strauss Anti-Skid Yoga Mat"".  The only problem with that is, its width is too lest ( 3mm). This makes it bad when doing any exercises involving knee.  Hence, I ordered this one seeing that this is 13mm thick.  On arriving I found out that the material used in the mat is mainly foam. I expected it to be rubber.  I tried doing exercise on this, but, found out that the low quality shall make it not last long & quite uncomfortable after some use. Hence asked for a return from Amazon after first use."
120,Hardik Jain,very slippery,2.0 out of 5 stars,  please dont buy this mat as it is extremely slippery. It is soft and comfortable but very slippery. so my suggest is to not buy this mat.
121,kundan nayak,Thickness good but quality not what I expected,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Thickness good but quality not what I expected
122,JPNelson,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had this yoga mat for a total of 4 days before it tore (delivered March 27 tore March 30). I used it the first 3 days at home for light stretching and a beginners yoga class on day 4. While turning on my heal into a different pose, it tore the fabric. So disappointing, I loved the colour, length & thickness. But if this happened my first class, it’ll be destroyed in no time. Will be returning :("
123,Ray,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not impressed with this product.  Right off the bat it seemed pretty good, very nice cushioning on the knees.  However, after only a few months of sporatic use, the foam is packing out at the ends where your feet would go for plank, downward dog etc.  I can tell the material will eventually fully disintegrate.  This would only be useful for going very light exercises and its too stretchy and slippery for yoga anyway.  Even plank would likely cause the foam to pack out."
124,George T,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  After reading several reviews and seeing multiple pictures of damaged mats, I decided to take a chance and get one. Turns out the mat I received was also damaged. Unfortunate to see how many of these mats slipped through the QA process, since it appears I’m not the only one with a faulty mat. Anyways, buyer beware, if you’re OK getting a cosmetically faulty product then by all means get one as it’s a decent mat for a decent price."
126,It. RV,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  El producto puede mejorar mucho, apenas llevo un mes usándolos y no creo que no durará mucho más, ya le comienzo a notar daños relacionados al uso.Yo lo compré básicamente por el grosor, para proteger las rodillas y en cuanto a eso no tengo ninguna queja,  pero en cuanto a la estabilidad que te brinda durante la ejecución de algunos ejercicios no es bueno, tiende a moverse y deformarse, lo cual hace que uno esté muy tenso durante la ejecución de determinadas posturas y uno podría sufrir algún accidente o lesionarse.Yo lo uso básicamente para Pilates, para los ejercicios que son recostados o sentados el tapete es útil, y cómodo. Pero para yoga no lo recomiendo nada, la única ocasión que lo intente usar terminé la clase sin el tapete por miedo a lastimarme.Así que depende completamente para que lo quieras es si esté tapete te será de utilidad o no."
127,Lala Michelle,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this mat thinking it was a great deal for the price, and it looked good.  I had to stop using it because it smells terrible and is really noisy.  It seems like it has a permanent ""gassing off"" smell that plastic sometimes has, but it doesn't go away, and the smell is left on me after I am done using it.  It is noisy as well when used.  It makes squeaky sounds from the friction on the floor and hands and feet.  I had to get rid of it and buy another mat.  I wish it was ok because the price is good."
128,soyabeans,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's exactly as advertised down to the measurements, but they could have omitted ""Extra Thick"". Instead, they just sugar coated something that should only be used for kids to play on. If you're in need of a mat, chances are the actual thickness won't cut it for you. The only thing that makes this deal work is if you had to buy a ton of them to give away. I've always given this house brand credibility on price-quality-value, this item was yet a reminder that there is a balance where ""good"" can never become ""awesome"". I would keep looking as there are other hassle-free ""Ships from and sold by"" mats that are indeed thicker."
129,Dima Alashram,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The only good thing about this matt is its thickness. Otherwise, it came with a factory smell that is still there even after four months of daily use and gently cleaning it. It also creases easily and gets small dents from where you put your fingers as you can see in the photo. It looks like it’s old and as if I had it for years even though it’s only around four months old. I don’t recommend this matt. The smell alone is a reason for me to buy a new matt."
130,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat would be perfect for my needs if it was durable / higher quality.I love the thickness and longer size of it.But it very quickly formed deep permanent impressions in the places where I put my knees, hands, elbows and feet. And I am a lightweight.Because of that I can't really recommend it unless you are using it only extremely lightly."
131,Autumn,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Love how thick this mat is! I had an issue with it ""bowing"" though when doing stuff like wide legged folds, or warrior 2. Not a bad buy though. Will likely go for something more all natural next time."
132,NB,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like that this mat is thick and easy on your body, but even after 6+ months, it has a funny chemical smell."
133,Val,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had it for a few months already. I'm only 145 pounds. I can feel that it won't last 2 years max. Comfortable, but probably made out of the cheapest degrading materials on purpose. This mat thing is in fashion. I won't buy an amazon product again."
136,Anna,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is enough thick so that it’s pretty comfortable when I sit or stand. .  But the yoga mat has an especially strong plastic smell  .can’t stand it .After 5 minutes yoga ,my hands and knees all smelled bad. It will be too troublesome to return  ,so I won’t return .but I don’t like it"
137,Ximena,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Es un mat que no se adhiere a pisos laminados. Se mueve muchísimo al hacer pilates o yoga. Hay tapetes del mismo precio con una mejor calidad que no se resbalan.Si no te importa si se mueve o no, cumple con el hecho de ser grueso y no te lastimas tanto las articulaciones."
138,0,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this item for my wife, she says it slides on the floor during activities, She is nervous using it.  Need to change the material so that it will be more stable during exercising..."
140,gailybird,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is nice and thick and comfy for yoga but it slips on the floor, it stains very easily, and I can tell it won't stand up to a lot of use; little bits are already coming off."
142,Emily Bardutz,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This yoga mat is about two to three times the thickness of a regular yoga mat. It's literally plush. Makes balancing REALLY hard and honestly just looks silly rolled up. Wish I would have just returned it right away instead of trying it.
143,Maxime,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I would not class this product as a yoga mat. It more a foam blanket that could be use for yoga. It does not stick to the floor very well and can easily be damaged because of the material.Not worth the buy...
144,Vandalovski,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Great mat BUT the strap is trash. I've had it for less than a week and the strap is almost broken. I had to buy a new one.
145,kjwburf,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Nice and thick, comfortable to lie on.  But the backing allows the mat to slide too much."
147,R. Naveen Kumar,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat looks good and comfortable to use. But, the quality is not as expected. Not for long term usage."
148,Ariel Reaper,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It will leave prints if you even sit on it. It doesn't age very well.More like a very thick towel than a yoga mat
149,Mrdribblebear,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Feels flimsy.  If looking for a cheap starter mat this is it.
150,Alexandra Galesloot,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not ideal for my yoga practice. Too thick, slips on the floor."
151,KLeht,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This mat is ok for basic exercises however when I became sweaty during yoga I would slip. Would not buy again.
152,Monica Infelise,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not as described. No strap included. Very thick mat but won't stay rolled up without strap.
153,Mikenze,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Cannot use this mat as it stretches during use, which makes it impossible to do yoga without pulling something"
154,Heidi Thomas,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Very thick and comfortable. Carrying strap ripped after putting on a couple times. Gets nicks really easy.
155,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great mat a little bigger than I thought, but I didn't receive the carrying strap that was advertised with my purchase"
156,shushanth,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I would not recommend this. Better to buy one from Walmart. Cheap quality.
157,CG,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used this mat for yoga, once a week. After 2 months, it’s already damaged."
159,Mrs Marion Hart,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not comfortable to exercise on
160,Reginald Lauzier ,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Trop épais pour yoga
161,Sehee jang,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Damage on mat 3diffrent of parts.
162,Sarah M McCormick,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too squishy, hurts knees."
164,Velda Page  Crawford,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  How do I get the smell off?
165,Julia Cecconi,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Started to tear second time using it.
166,TheOneManCritic,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Missing the strap!!!
173,Md Bappi Parvez,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  After opening the opposite side of the product was dirty. I need to clean it before using.
179,Catherine Ouellet,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is thick, yes, but poor quality. After only 1 week and a half of daily use, there's tearing all over it. Probably best for slow and light exercices. When I do Vinyasa yoga, it doesn't stay in place, stretches and now the tears gives it a cheap look. I recommend for stretching exercice or light movement, but not for yoga. I'm a bit disappointed."
182,christyann,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Loved the color and it seemed very soft and comfortable. It just had this funky fishy smell I couldn't handle. Had it for a month, unrolled it to air out the smell, and it still didn't go away. Returned."
183,Tania,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I just received the mat as you see it has defects and seems to have imprints if I don’t know what - perhaps someone’s feet...??? It has a small hole which it should have being that it is brand new.It’s a thick mat - for basic use (seems like it will fall apart quickly especially mine since it has a hole already). If anyone knows of a great Yoga Mat that is well made and has some thickness to support knees please advise. Thank you very much.
184,megan,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not a yoga mat -- it's too thick for standing/balancing poses, and it's weirdly stretchy, so if you try to do stretches, the mat moves with you rather than staying put (e.g., in downward dog, the part of the mat between your hands and feet spreads apart). To be fair, it's sold as an exercise mat, not a yoga mat. But it's still not great for standing/balancing. Fine for core work and seated and reclined stretches."
185,Monkey's Daddy,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  When I first took this out of the plastic shipping bag there was an almost overwhelming fishy odor to it.  I let the mat sit unrolled in our front room for a few days and then used it for the first time yesterday.  Now all I can smell when I'm near it is a very strong smell of sulfur.  It is very unpleasant...I hope it goes away quickly or I will have to return.The mat itself is quite comfortable and seems well made.  Since I've only used it once I can't really speak to anything else.  Dat smell tho'.
186,B. McCrobie,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is very thick and squishy. It is best used for yoga than as an exercise mat. Unfortunately, I purchased it for my home workouts which includes variations of planks, push-ups and burpees. The movement has caused tears, rips, and indentations. It is not holding up well to my style of workout. I recommend it for yoga, not a strength workout."
187,Dana,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It’s comfortable enough, but there is too much stretch and I’m constantly having to re-adjust my poses because the mat stretches and makes me over extend."
188,EHB,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I needed a new workout mat. I wanted one with a little more cushion than the one I had been using.This has too much cushion!  The softness adds unnecessary strain on my wrists in a downward dog or plank. Balancing becomes difficult because the mat wobbles back at you, unlike the floor. The material itself is so fragile that I’ve had it a week it’s already showing signs of wear and tear.When this dies, which probably won’t take long because if in a week it already has problems, I’m going to get something else."
189,Jenn Turner,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The carry strap that was supposed to come with the mat was NOT included. I plan to use this at home, so I don't need the strap to actually carry it anywhere, but it would be nice to be able to strap it up to store it when its not in use. It does have that new mat odd chemical smell, but I expect that will go away in time. The mat is comfortable, and perfect for sciatic stretching. I'm just upset that I didn't get the strap as promised. If I'd know the ad was incorrect and there was no strap, I never would have ordered it. If you're looking for a mat you can carry, do not order this one!"
190,Rottie fan 77,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pretty thick and spongy feeling, but not very durable, if I was you, I would spend a little more and go with a quality name brand,  I just use mine for regular  workouts and stretching, did things like push-ups and planks etc., mine tore a small hole in it within less than two months using it about four days a week for 10 to 20 minutes.  I didn't use anything superheavy her sharp that  should have torn a hole, I think it just tore  because the mat was stretching  beneath my weight in a plank or push-up type position, I weigh about 215 so not superheavy."
191,GR,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product information said that the item included a carrying strap.  When we received the package the wrapping material also said a strap was included.  THERE WAS NO STRAP!  There was no way to step the mat closed, let alone carry it.  The mat is also not nearly as comfortable as others we have tried.  Mostly though, we are annoyed that the packaging says one thing and the actual package didn't fulfill that.  We also noticed another review that mentioned the lack of the strap.  Don't know if this is a supplier mishap or just a lack of transparency in advertising."
192,Emily D,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I’m disappointed that after only about 30 uses for yoga, this mat is starting to fall apart in certain areas. Photos show the two areas that are damaged; the material is coming apart, getting stuck to my feet, and going onto the floor. Very unhappy that just a month of light yoga practice would cause damage like this."
193,John Colangelo,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat is definitely thick and provides cushioning, however it has some serious shortcomings.  The first issue I noticed is the bottom is slick and it slides around if you’re moving at all; I almost crashed and burned doing jumping jacks.  I tried the mat on multiple surfaces; same issue.  The other problem, along the same vein, is the material stretches, so even when doing static stretches, once your in a good position the material flexes and changes the position which throws you out of alignment and off balance.  Great  way to pull something.  I foresee this mat tearing soon."
194,Sarah Boye,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using this mat daily and thankfully, it is thick enough for my arthritic knees, however, every time I used it, I had a headache afterwards but couldn't figure out why. Then today, I realized that my cold had disappeared and the mat STINKS of plastic. I've had it for a week now out of it's package but it's still off-gassing enough to give me a headache.I'm really hoping that will go away with time, because I really do need to stretch and I can't get down on the floor on thinner mats."
195,Edgar,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is good and a decent thickness since we have wood floor. I hardly feel the wooden floor underneath me when I'm using it. However, 2 months later and this mat still has a horrible chemical smell. I put it in my closet and the whole closet smells of chemicals now when it's opened. Disappointing, because it's a great mat."
196,Lissa Heart,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat just smells so terrible. I've had it for several months. I have cleaned it multiple times, left it outside for weeks on end, and still it has that nasty plastic smell. I can't do yoga on it that involves getting my face anywhere near the mat. I have reverted back to my old mat because this one just will not stop reeking."
197,Smiling Buddha,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I had to stop using it soon after I bought it for two reasons:1. This mat slips a lot on wooden floor. My previous mats didn't slip on our wooden floors. But this is unsafe for our floors.2. The surface of the mat started to peal off after 3-4 weeks of use. Good mats last much longer. I only use this mat for crunches now.
198,Ash James,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product seems ok for price, but packs an uncomfortable pungent chemical smell. I have tried chlorox wipes, soaking with soap in the tub, and soaking with scented solutions-to no avail. Once I find a remedy for the odor, I will continue to test durability through use, but for know I will say that this mat is not designed for running mountain climber-type exercises-these will wear the mat out. I think it should sustain light yoga."
199,Reem Al Sinan-Oswald,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I like the mat a lot! Comfortable and only smells bad if you stick your nose up to it, so dont get too close. I anticipate using a towel for when I lay my face on the mat. HOWEVER, my mat arrived without a strap. Check quality control, I'm making my own strap out of rope!"
200,tess,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat will not stay still at all, and I'm pretty sure it's not because my floor is oozing with lube (trust me, it isn't). Seriously though, I am really disappointed in this mat. It's comfortable and the size is good, but I keep finding myself nervous to specific exercises on it because it might slip and slide all around. Take my advice, and find a better mat that people swear by will not slide."
201,Shivi,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  After less than a month of daily use for Pilates it’s started to peeling off . The cushion is good and extra thick as mentioned . The size and color also good . And it’s easy to carry with the straps but the quality is poor it seems .
202,Buckeye Mom,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat works well but it has a terrible smell. The smell is most strong when I unroll it at the beginning of class. By mid class the smell is no longer there. But after using it for a month, the smell is this there every time I unroll the mat. Very disappointing."
203,Teresa,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is horrible! And the carrying strap, might as well put a belt around the yoga mat to carry it with.On the positive side, it would make a great mat for the kiddos to lay on for tv watching and/or nap. But for yoga....nope."
204,Mike V,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mat was great at first, nice and soft. Except once I used it for about 2 months of yoga (1-2 times a week) it started to break down. Wherever I put my feet/palms/knees would quickly flatten and become thinner than a normal yoga mat. This problem is mostly due to the low density of the foam wearing down quickly."
205,Amy,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I thought this would be the best for extra support with poses that are hard on the knees but I found that it is really bad for everything else. The mat is so stretchy that it pulls further apart making you sink further into the splits in every pose. Also makes it really difficult to balance because it has so much give and not enough support to balance on one foot. Very noisy when moving or adjusting your feet as well. I'm going back to my old mat and will just roll it up for more support on the knees.
206,Anne,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I could buy the same quality for so much cheaper but I’m currently stuck home and stores are closed so I’m not returning it because would like to get some yoga in my times but way too expensive..
207,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was really excited to finally try a mat that was thicker, hoping it would make certain positions in yoga more comfortable for my knees/back, but unfortunately I was kind of disappointed when this mat arrived. It wasn’t in the best condition, with a couple of little cuts in the foam throughout the mat, and though the thickness is nice for certain positions, it makes simple balancing positions more difficult."
208,Mister Reviewer ,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This should not be used for standing yoga as it the extra thickness of the foam can cause instability and injury especially in hot yoga where there is alot of sweat. Also, this mat came out the box with a repugnant smell that resembled cat urine. I tried airing it out and little improvement. You may have to wash it in a washing machine, but it may fall apart. Also, the strap was poorly constructed and fell apart."
209,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I searched hard on Amazon for a longer sized yoga mat. This one has the desired thickness and length. Unfortunately it stretched so much during the first yoga class I took it to I was worried about injuring myself. The more I sweat, the worse it got."
210,Lydia Kelley,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Super soft and padded...but deadly slippery. Almost broke my neck when it slid out from under me in yoga class. If it were slip proof, I'd give it a 5. Yogis beware."
211,jdwarrior,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I really like this mat, but am already looking to purchase another after using it for less than a month. When changing positions, my feet, hand, arms, etc. stick to the mat pulling it up. This causes the mat to bunch up and is extremely annoying. My old mat never did this."
212,Cathy B.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Did not come with the advertised carrying strap. It is very disappointing when you are deceived by false advertising.
213,DC,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this as my first mat, do not have any experience with other mats. After about 8-10 hours of use, the foam has already started to tear.Pros:+ Inexpensive+ Foam is comfortableCons:- Does not seem durable, if it doesn't tear it will eventually develop divots if kept in the carrier.- Foam is soft and compresses easily and unevenly, can make balancing poses difficult.- Foam stretches during use which makes lunges and other positions difficult.- On any hardwood floor it will sound like flatulence."
214,C,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I love the thickness of this mat however I feel like it doesn't have enough ventilation. It gets very sweaty very quickly and is ""hot"" to work on."
215,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Bought for yoga when I first started - not great for anything but a restorative class. It’s not easy to balance in it and tore after the first time I used it.
216,Christopher Nichols,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is long and thick. Good for yoga, but doesn’t work for other excerise because it slides on the floor. I would not recommend."
217,Nc,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was using a thin yoga mat on concrete floors and was bruising my knees and pelvic bone during certain moves because there was hardly any cushion.  This extra thick mat is great--except it stinks.  I read the reviews that said the mat smelled, and decided, as some reviewers noted, that the claims were definitely overstated.  Well, I was proved wrong.  The mat reeks-- and it's not just new plastic smell.  It's some sort of rank...I don't know.  I can't really describe the particular odor.  I've only used the mat 3x, and stopped after the smell was transferring onto my clothes after a workout.  I've had it aired out and sprayed off every day for a week and it still stinks.  Don't ignore the stink warning!!"
218,Just a customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is quite cheap and I like the color. But it's very stretchy. It's thick, so it's good for kneeling down. However, it's difficult to keep your balance on it. If you have a wooden floor, don't buy it. It keeps moving when I do exercise."
219,Sbee,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not for studios with wood floors. Had me slippin and giving me a hard time just doing poses. You could only use this for outdoor cement platform. Cuz gworl, use these in the yoga studio, you’d be pretzeling inside out the wrong way."
220,Evan,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used it for about 2 mos. and the face of the mat is starting to crack, it's comfortable on the knees but it shifts on the hardwood floor, too dangerous for standing posts, I end up buying a new mat to replace it."
221,SHAZnyc,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  After only the first time using this mat, there are visual tears. When putting too much pressure on the mat -- as such, digging my toes into it while doing pushups -- it seems to make holes easily.I will have to return it and request a refund."
222,Kenny Dennis,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  cheap price but cheap quality tooonly buy if budget is main concern
223,Conscientious consumer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I thought it would be more comfortable  to use.  I am a senior citizen.  Not great when you have to use your elbows to get up.  Painful.
224,Alyse,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Didn’t come with the carrying strap as advertised. The mat itself is nice, but very incovenient for transport not to have the strap that was promised."
225,dave b,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Fine mat for yoga but no carrying strap included as stated.  It is a pain to roll and carry in bag, but a bigger pain to return."
226,S.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat is a very thick cushion that feels good when you lay on it for sit ups or are on your knees.  The durability of the mat however is very low.  If you even slightly step on it your shoes will cut through it and destroy it.  I unfortunately only used the mat twice and now have big torn marks on it.
227,E. C. Hall,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  perfect if you never sweat. Lightweight foam is dense and provides a lot of comfort. Far better than thinner mats. But it get's slippery when wet. Sweat on it and you'll be scooting around like a dog on ice
228,Klohver,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I did not receive the carry strap with my mat. The mat itself is good though. I’ll have to return since the order was incomplete.
229,Karolina,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is a good soft mat, but unfortunately very slippery. I ended buying another one, non slippery that is not as thick but much better for yoga."
230,Pegah,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat arrived already defected. Returned it today. The material it is made of is very suceptible to damage. When you squeeze it a little, there is a mark left for a long time that shows if you use it regularly for yoga, in no time you are left with a bunch of wrinkles and torned edges.In short, the material is cheap, the mat is gonna work for you a couple of months at best and the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is that it actually is thick and comfy.EDIT: It did smell horribly and the straps were missing too."
231,Kimberly LaRue,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I like that is a thick but the picture is deceiving! There is no handle to make it easier to carry to a yoga class. False advertisement. It specifically states with carrying strap!
232,missy thompson,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It smells horrible.  I’ve cleaned it multiple times and it is awful.  It has a small puncture in the middle of it as well.I was really disappointed in this product.
233,Nina,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The mat is fine, but mine was delivered without the carrying strap."
234,carlsonbjj,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  ok mat but way thicker than your average mat, and tough to roll up"
235,Jorie A Doyle,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great thickness, but disappointing that it didn’t come with the carrying straps as listed when I bought the mat!"
236,Andrea,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The material it's made out of appears like it will work and hold up well. However, it didn't come with the strap which makes it a lot harder to store or at least something else I need to find and purchase. Overall my only reason for scoring this down was that missing strap."
237,H. Stone,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  decent mat but didnt come with a carrying strap.
238,HinNC,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Product arrived on time. Smells a little but the main reason I am upset is that it doesn't include carrying strap! Now I am supposed to pack and return a
239,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Initial impressions of the mat are positive, but the product description explicitly says the purchase includes a carrying strap (in fact there is an entire paragraph describing the strap along with a photo of a woman carrying the mat with the strap). The product I received had no strap."
240,Nnm,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The mat came without carrying strap. Mat itself is good but without the stray very difficult to walk around. I am returning it.
241,DougD,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Rips, creases quickly, cracks, too soft. Too pricey for the quality."
242,Greggory Schwartz,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Only used it 3 or 4 times, but the mat gets the job done. I've used it for ab workouts on a hard floor, and it's been quite comfortable. However, the carrying strap already broke so now it's not as easy to store."
243,Mariah,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This mat would do very well on surfaces that already have a lot of traction. It, however, performs terribly on our hardwood floors. The mat slips and stretches when doing many exercises, making it somewhat risky to do planks or lunges. If it had a grippier bottom, this would be great, but it is mediocre at best."
244,Luis F Baby,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  solid mat use it everyday, was only disappointed cause the strap was missing lol still pretty good."
245,Noemy L. Carpio,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  After three weeks of use, the mat is starting to fall apart. My clothes and body end up covered in tiny particles of the material that makes up the mat. I am disappointed in the durability of this item for the price."
246,Cynthia N.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Although it is a thick mat, it isn't cushiony at all and it smells bad/like chemicals. I've used it 3-4 times hoping the smell would go away and that it would be broken in/softer and more supportive but no luck. I'll likely donate the mat and purchase another Champion mat (comparable and worth the extra money)"
247,Jason Grams,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's nice and cushy in a good color, but stretches and tears too easily from the pressure of knees, etc. doing yoga."
248,Arlene,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I thought it would come with the carrying strap.
249,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice cushion but it's like a slip and slide of you start to sweat.
0,kartik,A reliable name,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seagate drives, I have been using them since a decade now and so far there has not been one data loss experience with me. The drive is as reliable as it gets and has decent read/write speeds. I have put the screenshots for the performance and total available space.There is one complaint though, the drive arrived with very poor packing it was wrapped into a plastic component bag and put into the amazon courier bag, not even a box!! This is a very crucial component and I hope the seller improves on that.I am using this drive as an external drive and would surely recommend anyone who is looking for a drive for external use. But for an internal drive I would not recommend this.If you are looking for an internal drive then I would suggest you look for an Solid State Drive(SSD) and if your budget is not as high then go for a solid state hybrid drive(SSHD) at the very least. These conventional HDD's are outdated in terms of 2018 performance standards."
1,Sreedev,Good Sequential Read/Write - Poor Random Read/Write,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this as a replacement for my primary hard disk in my old pc. I am using it as my boot drive.For sequential reads/writes you can expect copy speeds of around 100MBps while copying to another device and not within the hdd itself. Even during these copies , I could see response time upwards of 500ms.If you are using it as your boot drive, you can expect very bad read/write speeds with response times around 5000-6000ms most of the time whenever the hdd is not idle.Good as a secondary hard disk.Poor performance as boot drive."
2,Anonymous,Not that great,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Performance is not as expected, read/write speeds are ok for a mechanical HDD but compared to my old Seagate momentus which originally came with the laptop, this one is running hot by 10 degrees (47 degrees) and it's a bit noisy, I have tested it using Seatools and it passed all tests but I don't know if this will last as long, my old HDD lasted for 6 years.For an old laptop just get an SSD, it's less storage for the same price but in terms of upgrades it's a better buy."
3,mohan.s,Nice one,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Will check after 6 months,replaced HDD with sdd,,, super fast now booting, copying etc,,First time I use Sata SOlid state,, good fast,, anybody pls buy this"
4,Sudeep,No SATA cable and no screws,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Kudos to amazon in its delivery as expected delivery date was 12th July and received it on 9th July. Product working fine, no problems at all. However i struggled to fit the Hard Drive as no screws and no SATA cable was provided with the Hard Drive, Its a common sense to give the necessary things so that the user can fit it to the CPU, (Its like giving a phone with no battery, lol).SATA cable I can at least go n buy it locally although it wont be durable, but from where will I get the correct matching screws?? Hence had to search then my friend had a failed hard drive and from him i took the screws and fitted it as the screws matched(because failed one was also seagate, lol).Who ever is buying this, this is for you, The product is fine, no doubt about it, coming to fitting, you have to take care of screws and SATA cable."
5,Chalapati,"First HDD DOA, replaced it and got a corrupted HDD. (Fixed it later...)",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The first hdd was DOA (dead on arrival) and the packaging was horrible (literally, no bubble wrapping or any soft protection...) and after replacement, the second hdd was technically defected as the partition type was RAW. So, I had to change the file type to NTFS by commandpropt (Cmd) and get it fixed manually.P.S. The packaging for replacement was as bad as the one before."
6,Ajay G.,It makes a lot of noise on startup for nearly ...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It makes a lot of noise on startup for nearly 8 minutes, after that it settles down. Presently the HDD is working, but don't know what the noise is about and its long term effects on performance of the product.Once have had problem in boot up, hence had to go for ""Safe Mode"". Am still uncertain about the product. This is a long term buy product which has to give trouble free operation for some years."
7,Ruksana B.,Comes with absolutely nothing.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I expected this ssd to be faster. In terms of packaging,it comes with absolutely nothing. Not even the screws to screw it in your ssd slot. You don't get a SATA cable either. In my honest opinion,you should look for a different model that atleast has screws to fasten the drive on to your slot."
8,Amazon Customer,Good Product But Bad Package,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is Good.. But the Packaging is horrible.. it arrived just in a bubble wrap.. no box nothing.. it had a small dent on rhw hard drive..u can see it in the pic.. It runs well thankfully..will see if it makes problem or not then I will return it within ten days.. 10/10 for Seagate.. 3/10 for Amazon in packaging.. They need to understand that this product is fragile and needs to be handled with care..
9,Manav,How to claim warranty,3.0 out of 5 stars,  For some reasons thr drive stopped working and after showing it to an expert I came to know there is a problem in the PCB. Now I don't know how to claim warrenty and the Seagate customer service is not at all helpful.
10,Elton Menezes,Good Hard Disk,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good hard disk but packaging was bad, it could easily harm the disk. Seller should be aware how to handle hard drives since they have moving parts within them and any shock could damage it."
11,Raif Rayan,Horrible packaging.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The packaging is horrible. No protection whatsoever to the drive. Hard drives are easy to damage because slightest bumps can cause huge dents on the disk inside. As you can see in the video, the drive was not carefully packed and I don't know if it's damaged. Will have to wait for a few days to know for sure. If you hear a scraping sound after running the drive, it's definitely broken and should be replaced immediately. Other than that, the drive is good."
12,Amazon Customer,Read all reviews before buying,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't buy this kind of old model HDD ..The package was not good and the product I recieved was new but during usage the disk makes sharp noise ,a Crick sound ( a metal metal scratching noise)very very often ..iam really worried that HDD might soon fail...even though I can claim warranty if failed but I need to buy an external HDD to backup files every day fearing failure.....Total capacity is 931.5 GB...working fine except that sharp metal noise which can be heared 3 feet away from laptop...."
13,𝕾𝖆𝖌𝖆𝖗 𝕸 𝕽𝖊𝖉𝖉𝖞,Got the replacement and it's working fine. Thankyou verymuch great product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Received the replacement and it's working fine.At first I got a defective hdd, which was making click crrrik sound and was not detected by computer.Then I placed a replacement request and got the product.I purchased seagate external hdd before had no problems,  but this was the first internal hdd that had problem.Delivery was a little bit slow which took 5 more days than the initial delivery.But overall the product is good.Thankyou amazon."

97,Oishik Sarkar,15+ years Seagate user finally moved to WD,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  15+ years I've been using and recommending Seagate drives as Seagate Barracuda 3.5"" Desktop drives are significantly slimmer than WD Blue, weights less that makes it easy if needed to carry around and those drives are extremely silent as compares to WD. Yes, I'm discussing silly points as I've used 1000s of HDDs till date and believe me comparing performance of both drives doesn't make sense, as both drives has almost similar specs having 7200 RPM, similar sized buffer and so on hence gives almost similar kind of performance. So why I moved to WD then?Well! all over the internet every tech reviewer of every channel always compares products based on performance, that in my sense isn't what consumer should look at first place. What if you copy your project files to HDD1 at double the speed of HDD2. After a year when you try to access the data, Boom! HDD1 isn't getting detected anymore. Does this make sense now?When talking about storage devices first thing you should look is reliability. For me 5-7 out of 10 Seagate drives fails just after 1-3 years of use. On the other hand I found only 1-2 WD drives out 10 fails in 1-3 years of time period. Don't get me wrong I've seen 10+ years old HDD running smoothly in both the cases but still this is hard truth that Seagate drives now a days has started failing more often. Here's my overview on both brands.Pros of WD Blue over Seagate Barracuda:1. Seagate Service Center is very bad in my city.2. Chances of Data Recovery are much higher in WD.3. WD HDD Motherboard is easy to repair and easy to swap.4. WD Drives feels much more premium in terms of build quality.5. Few times Seagate Sata connectors broke, but this never happened with WD.6. WD Drive Firmware is much stable rather than Seagate's infrequent Firmware releases.7. If you put these drives in NAS and start using it 24x7, WD Drives runs cooler than Seagate.8. Head movement tickling sound is higher in Seagate than any WD, except WD Datacenter Gold Drives.9. If head is stuck, there is high chance of repositioning it in WD, where as in Seagate sometimes makes mark on platter.Cons of WD Blue over Seagate Barracuda:1. Double the size, more bulkier, hence hard to put in smaller cases.2. Noisier, I mean I can hear the WD drive spin up from 2 feet distance.But with Seagate I don't know how but they're extremely quiet.3. If you monitor closely WD Drives takes little more watt from SMPS than Seagate.4. Pricing is always few hundred rupees higher than competitive Seagate or Toshiba Drive.5. Recovery of particular bad sector is easy in Seagate Barracuda drives than WD lue/Green."
98,Vinnu Rey,Before i was using 500GB HDD in Acer Aspire But ...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Before i was using 500GB HDD in Acer Aspire But Now Purchased 1TB..Ordered On Monday..Got Today Morning @ 10am .. Till evening working correctly.. After  fave days i will again Write ReviewThank you ..
99,Hari,Not worth it.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Try buying a different product. Mine failed exactly 1 year after purchase. Although they gave me a replacement the HDD shouldn't have failed. I was lucky that I had a back up of my photos and videos. My games are all gone.
100,Shubham,Three Stars,3.0 out of 5 stars,  speed is slow.....nd hanging problem
101,Uzair Ali,WD vs Seagate,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hey Guys,I would like to tell you that most of the people are confused that whether to buy a WD blue or the Seagate Barracuda, i purchased both of the drives and they perform the same after the 3 months.When i purchased the barracuda it was around 4,000 and the WD was 3,200 so price is the only thing different btw the WD looks a little bit cheap and Seagate looks premium.That's my opinion on both drives i recommend the Seagate Barracuda.Thank you!"
102,Pedro L.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  El producto llegó en el plazo anunciado. Compré dos por error ya que en el primer intento la compra falló y al solucionar el problema inicié de nuevo la compra y al final cuando me llegaron los dos decidí no devolver uno.Comprados en Julio del año pasado y con dos años de garantía Seagate. Al cabo de 7 meses uno de los disco falló y he perdido toda la información contenida en el.Me puse en contacto con el anunciante y ni se dignó a contestarme. Escribí a Seagate y me dieron una serie de instrucciones para comprobar que efectivamente no funcionaba. A partir de ahí me dijeron que pasos debía seguir para iniciar la devolución para el cambio.Entre el envío de mi disco averiado y la recepción de uno nuevo han transcurrido 15 días aproximadamente y el modelo no es el mismo porque el mío tenía memoria previa física a parte del disco y el nuevo no pero a cambio el mío era de un tera y el nuevo es de dos.Para este tipo de artículos aconsejo siempre registrarlos en la web del fabricante.
103,Greatblackhawk,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I wanted to upgrade my 500GB Seagate with the 1TB Barracuda.I was so convinced that this would be amazing that from the get-go I refused to believe that part of the problems I was experiencing after it’s installation was due to this HDD!My Laptop became so slow to boot it was dreadful and virtually unusable.Eventually I replaced it with a far better HDD and all is good now.
104,Scott,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The hard drive is making static noise and it's very annoying.
105,Jonathan Smith,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hard drive works with great speeds. However, delivery leaves a lot to be desired. Hard drive arrived with zero protective packaging around it. Bumps along delivery is most the likely the cause of the rhythmic noise the hard drive produces."
106,JJ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Seems ok, but the drive is making reasonably loud scratching sounds... concerned this may fail soon... will update if this stops or persists, or fails."
107,Anonymous,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The hard-drive is working but is making a strange clicking noise (about every 10 seconds).I want to return it but amazon doesn't accept returns... I've ordered it last week!EDIT: Thanks amazon for replacing it
108,Gurj Virdee,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good price. But performance is very poor and very noticeable when loading Windows. I have 2 identical HP machines and one is quicker with a different hard drive.
109,Harco,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  when powered on for the first time got the 'click', so not sure its a quality item. luckily its only to use as an external so should be ok"
110,Mark,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Right label wrong size hard drive , sent back"
111,Neobutt,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good item

113,MGD,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  No issue
114,Jeli,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not the fastest of hard drives!
115,Neil Braithwaite,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Lasted a year before it picked up.
116,sherina kimera,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Damaged
117,Oskar Monroe,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  its ok
118,Client d'Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  disque mal protégé dans le transport  (on sait que c'est un élément fragile!) pas de papier à bulle ! enveloppe déchirée !!quel dommage que le transport ne soit pas à la hauteur!malgré tout, heureusement, le disque fonctionne bien.c'est pour cela que je ne mets que 3 étoiles."
119,Adam Gabourie,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this drive for all my photos and videos. I used it as an external HDD and worked well for a little over a year. Then it suddenly crashed for no reason. I used to swear by Seagate products for their reliability but now I have to reconsider using one.I couldn't retrieve anything on it. It was like my computer could no longer see it when connected. I tried every program, fix, and app to try to retrieve what I lost but it didnt work. I'm very upset about losing all those special moments and memories. I guess it's my own fault for not backing them up, but I was counting on Seagate's reliability."
120,Kevin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  At first it seems to disconnect or becomes unreadable randomly but over time it occurred less and less. Not sure if it was a ""break in"" period or not but I'm glad I gave it a chance before instantly returning it. I wanted to wait to make a review so I can testify a bit more on it's longevity. Been using it for about half a year or almost. It performed as expected however since day one it made this weird humming noise. I was hoping it would go away after the ""break in"" period but to this day it still does it. Makes me a bit nervous about lifespan or if it's semi defective and at any moment it will completely fail on me. If it wasn't for those flaws, this would have been an easy perfect stars product for me... Sadly in my situation that isn't the case :("
121,Nicola,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Speravo in qualcosa di meglio con questo disco interno della Seagate da 4 Tb e invece non mi sembra. A parte l'imballo piuttosto spartano, il disco gira spesso e si sente tanto, lento nella lettura dei file e delle foto, ad esempio in una cartella con circa 350 foto, è lentissimo e le fa vedere piano piano, sinceramente mi aspettavo qualcosa di meglio vista anche la memoria tampone da 256 Mb... (è più lento del precedente WD da 3Tb). Adesso sto cercando di capire se tenere questo disco oppure prenderne uno nuovo, dovrei comprarne anche un altro ma non sarà un Seagate."
122,alfonso angel fredi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bueno ,bonito y barato funciona al cien ya lo llene de juegos y parece no afectarle me llegó con cero horas de uso, nuevo al 100% .Lo único malo fue la entrega tardo dos días más y ya se les hizo costumbre todos mis maquetes llegan después y Aceves hasta se molestan por qué no les puedo recibir el paquete uno o dos días después del tiempo de entrega por qué estoy en el trabajo .Después de poco más de seis meses estoy teniendo problemas con el disco espero que lo puedo solucionar sin acudir a garantía igual solo lo usé paga guardar juegos ."
123,Enrique Segura,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  El disco por marca me parece excelente, he tenido varios discos duros Seagate y hasta el momento no he tenido algún problema. Por precio qué decir, salió extremadamente barato por oferta de Buen Fin, el detalle es la forma en cómo se empaca el producto para transportarlo, sólo se envía con bolsa antiestática sin ninguna protección contra algún golpe o movimiento que pudiera dañarlo, lo voy a utilizar para actualizar mi PS4 pero antes debo hacer pruebas para verificar que el disco no haya sufrido algún daño. Inconcebible que hasta el momento Amazon no haga nada al respecto y siga enviando productos delicados en estás condiciones, ya que al igual terminan afectando la reputación de una marca sólo por detalles en el transporte. Obviamente si hay daño en el disco lo tendré que devolver."
124,PMendoza10,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pedí 3 discos y 2 me llegaron dañados, cuando escribías sobre el disco trababa toda la computadora y el disco desaparecia, no sé si volvería a pedir porque da desconfianza cómo llega el producto, solo en una bolsita de plastico, hasta parece pirata. Me cambiaron los discos y hasta ahorita que ha pasado más de medio año no he tenido priblemas, pero sigo con la desconfianza de los discos."
125,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This drive has poor wright performance, and should be used for archival purposes only. I literally get less than 5mb/s wright speeds, which is pathetic. It also has a low duty cycle, which if you're using it as a system drive, you will easily exceed, so it won't last very long in that use case... I intend to retire this drive to arvlchival purposes only and replace it with something better..."
126,Andreas Preissler,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Wie gewohnt bei Amazon bestellt und schon beim auspacken über den schlechten Versandkarton und Umkarton der Platte gewundert (die lag nämlich lose in der antistatischen Hülle). Wurde dann auch nicht richtig vom Rechner erkannt (anderes Kabel, BIOS Update und externer Anschluss probiert).Sie ließ sich einfach nicht formatieren und als Laufwerk hinzufügen.Kurzerhand retour und Ersatz beantragt. Die Ersatzplatte hat sofort funktioniert, auch die Verpackung war geringfügig besser und auch die antistatische Hülle...Ein komischer Beigeschmack bleibt ob ich zunächst eine gebrauchte Platte bekommen hatte..."
127,LUYSCAR,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  He montado el PC desde cero comprando las piezas en amazon. Esta montado con una placa base Gigabyte GAZ37AGK3-00-G con inter core i5 8ª generacion, RAM 2X4GB.MALO. Seguramente me he quedado algo corto, deberia haberle instalado un disco duro solido."
128,Manuel Fabbri,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  il prodotto rispecchia a pieno la descrizione data, peccato per la spedizione dove, un hdd messo in una scatola senza pluriball o carta per proteggerlo dagli urti, mi sembra una cosa da evitare...tempi di spedizione tipici di amazon, al momento sembra funzionare a meraviglia ma sicuramente essendo stato sbattollato nel trasporto non ha giovato alla vita dell'hardware..."
129,Luis A. Dominguez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Lo he comprado para sustituir el disco que tengo en el ordenador de sobremesa con datos, fotos,... por que el anterior me daba problemas y parecía a punto de morir. Ahora ya no tengo esos problemas, pero el disco nuevo me parece muy lento comparado con el viejo que tenía más de 10 años.Cuando trabajo con archivos de Word grandes tarda una eternidad en grabarlos y cuando abro cualquier otro archivo con cualquier aplicación, tarda en abrirse mucho más que el disco duro viejo. Seguro que hay alternativas mejores."
130,Angelo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  L'hard disk è arrivato nei tempi previsti, chiuso in una semplice bustina di plastica rivestita di pluriball. Appena connesso al computer ha fatto un rumore strano, somigliante a quello di parti metalliche che sfregano tra loro. L'hard disk funziona perfettamente, ma ogni volta che lo connetto o che scrivo/copio qualche file emette questo strano rumore.Spero non mi abbandoni presto."
131,Pierrette V.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Le disque dur en lui même fonctionne, mais dessus était installé une version de windows en allemand ? Le produit aurait dû être vide et sans logiciel..."
132,Bodo-Norbert Göldner,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Die Festplatte wurde im einem Karton geliefert und an meinem Ablageort geschmissen. Leider ist die HDD zu langsam und hatte bei der Installation von Windows7 Ultimate Schreib- und Lesefeher angezeigt. Daher habe ich die HDD Lowlevel formatiert und wird morgen wieder zurück gesendet.. Alternativ habe ich mir eine ""HGST Travelstar 7K1000 1TB interne Festplatte (7200rpm; SATA 6Gb/s; 32MB Cache; 6,3cm (2,5""))"" bestellt, welche wesentlich schneller läuft."
133,Riccardo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Dopo poco tempo mi ha dato problemi con programmi che necessitano di creare/gestire file grandi in poco tempo come Adobe Premiere PRO o After Effects.Il mio disco funziona per tutto il resto (il disco sembra tutto ok, firmware aggiornato ecc) però non funziona per nulla con quei programmi, causando crash e freeze del sistema. Ho provando con un HDD diverso gli stessi programmi sullo stesso sistema e non ho avuto problemi."
134,Frederick,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  pues como ven en la foto, pedi otras cosas y asi me llego el disco duro, suelto entre las otras cosas y solo en una bolsita sin proteccion a los golpes, me llego sin formato y sin particion, lo iba a regresar por que mi pc no lo detectaba y creia que se habia dañado en el camino. despues de instalar algunos programas me di cuenta que le faltaba crear particion y formato. quitando eso, excelente articulo."
135,Electroduende7,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  No es la marca más puntera en discos duros pero si una de las que más se vende. Era para clonar un viejo disco que me estaba dando problemas y de momento funciona bien.Solo un pero, llegó muy bien el paquete y el disco duro en una funda que parecía que no había sido abierta, pero al descubrirlo me dí cuenta que tenía como dos pequeñas muescas, es como si le hubieran dado un golpe con algo. No me he quejado ya que no parece afectarle para nada, pero deberían tener un mejor control de calidad."
136,Amber Johnstone,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Missing SATA cable and screws. I happen to have a few SATA cables sitting around but that doesnt excuse it. I dont have the correct screws in my box so it is just sitting loose on my hard drive mount.
137,JorgeRG85,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  El producto lamentablemente no encendió al querer conectarlo a una estación de anclaje para poder formatearlo. Muy buena marca, he comprado muchos de sus productos, solo que esta vez vino defectuoso, pero se hizo la devolución y todo salió bien!"
138,H. P,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ich habe schon mehrere Festplatten von Seagate gekauft, sie alle waren gut, bei der Letzter, scheint mir, ist nicht alles in Ordnung,  sie gibt von sich seltsame Geräusche...  Mal sehen, wie lange sie aushält."
139,Valoron,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Technisch soweit ok, Allerdings habe ich von 5 dieser Festplatten 3 aussondern müssen, weil bei jeder beim Abziehen des SATA-Kabels, die kleine Plastikschiene über den Kontakten abgebrochen ist."
140,C. Samuel,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Acheté fin Aout 2018 et installé dans la foulée pour plus de capacité d'enregistrement, il rends l'âme en mai 2020, plus d'accès aux données, pas reconnu par windows. Garanti 2 ans, l'assistance technique Amazon m'envoie une prise en charge de retour et me rembourse intégralement.Au final perte conséquente de données perso (photos...etc...), mais sous garantie donc moindre mal."
141,R. Jasperse,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  De levering van de disk was prima. Maar het in de laptop inbouwen ging niet zonader problemen.Diskmanager (Windows 10  2004) herkende de disk niet en meldde een 2 TB capaciteit.Op een andere computer een low level format app gedaan. Dat werkt ... na 2 uur.Raar.
142,Sebastien,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bonjours , mon nom est Sébastien Caron , j'ai acheté 2 Seagate barracuda 4tb et il en a 1 sur 2 qui a 2 tb mais il était écrit 4 tb sur le disque dur , sans m'en rendre compte j'ai installé Windows 10 sur celui-là . Mon erreurs mais que pouvons nous faire ? Ces la première fois que ça m'arrive ?"
143,Mario,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Llego en buen estado el producto; más sin embargo nunca funciono, lo detectó el sistema y me marcaba 0mb, probe otro disco duro y funciono perfectamente... El disco no sirve, acabo de iniciar el reembolso a ver si no se tardan... Debería haber un control de calidad mayor con sus productos."
144,Juan Carlos Sosa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disco Duro Barata con excelente capacidad, aunque el desempeño se logra con discos de estado solido, asi que siempre buscalos en pareja."
145,Joseph,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This hard drive is a slim 2tb hard drive, with big cache and lower power consumption 5400rpm spin.  Unfortunately, if speed is what you're looking for this hard drive can't beat a 7200rpm hard drive (except ssd) with lesser cache.  For a ps4 upgrade, this hard drive has a lot more space, but is only slightly faster."
146,Client d'Amazon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Rien à dire sur les disques. Utilisé dans un boitier adapté pour mettre 2 disques 2.5"" dans un emplacement 3.5"", pour une utilisation sur serveur perso (donc pas violent non plus), je les ai laissé tourner à 100% via badblocks pour vérifier leur état pendant une semaine avant de les utiliser de maniere operationnel. Et ils marchent depuis 3 mois sans soucis.La livraison a par contre été............ un carton ENOOOORME (taille A4, sur au moins 15cm de hauteur) pour deux disques durs dans leur enveloppe plastique antistatique avec une très mince couverture de film bulle, et trois ballon d'air dedans.Bref, plutot moyen la livraison, d'ou la baisse de note. (Et j'aurais du prendre 2To plutot que 1, mais ça c'est autre chose ^^)"
147,Ricardo A.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Lo que pasa es que un día dejó de funcionar empezó a sonar y mandaba a las bios cuando solo tenía dos meses afortunadamente Amazon respondió y me mandaron otro sin embargo me han recomendado mucho los wd que son mejores deberían de intentar con esos
148,Sara Breedveld,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Does not come with sata or power cable.Comes in a plastic bag in a bubble wrapped envelope.  Nothing else.
149,alessandro,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  secondo me per essere un hdd nuovo scalda un po troppo e fa un po di rumore insomma non è silenzioso come mi aspetterei da un HDD nuovofa il suo ma senza aspettative
150,Antonio,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Imballaggio davvero pessimo.Per il resto ormai come tutti gli hdd non ci sta molto da dire.. è lento ma se si deve utilizzare per il solo immagazinamento di documenti ad esempio: pdf, word etc etc è buono"
151,JoseNonStop,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Es un disco duro basico sin mucho más que añadir. Lo hemos colocado para grabar en un sistema de vigilancia y de momento no fallo. Para su precio esta bastante bien.

154,Matthew Krautsieder,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The drive was listed without any rpmListed in the title. Now the rpm is listed in the title at 5400 which makes me upset cuz i was hoping it was 7200 .
155,Konstantin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Assez déçu par l’emballage de disque. Pas de boite en carton de produit, très peu de papier dans la boite pour caler le disque. Sachant qu'à l'intérieur de disque il y a des pièces mécaniques(par forcément fragile mais quand même...), on pourrait mettre un peu plus de papier ou prendre un boitier 3 fois plus petit.Pour l'instant fonction bien  à voir sur long terme."

229,Aaron Carrigan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This hard drive came in a sealed static bag then placed in a bubble wrap pouch. That is it. No further packaging to prevent shock or vibrations.No instructions either. Literally a drive and the packaging described above. Would be helpful for some on how to get this drive working, even a simple set of instructions. As I can imagine not everyone knowing what to do.For anyone who has initialized a hard drive before, connect the device. Go to disk manager, it should show up saying unformatted disk. Select the disk, right click and go to format. Use NTFS, or if wishing yo use this as an external hard drive in android devices format as exFAT. Android can't read NTFS without using 3rd party apps or using rooted firmware. Once formatted, you're good to go.Also as mentioned it can be used as an external drive, there are cases out there which can be used. But I suggest a case using USB C 3.1, simply because it future proofs it and allows the drive to work at its maximum speed if connected to USB 3.1 on the other end.In all, good drive and works. Just the lack of decent packaging and instructions let's it down."
230,Jakker,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  13.02.2018:Vorab: Eine Rezension über das eigentliche Produkt werde ich in ein paar Wochen nachreichen, wenn einigermaßen sicher ist, dass die Teile nicht beschädigt sind.Es ist mir vollkommen unverständlich, wie man Festplatten, die nur in einer Antistatikfolie verpackt sind, lose mit anderen Produkten in einen Karton legen kann. Da hilft es auch nicht, wenn oben drauf 6 Luftbeutel liegen. Selbst die Antistatikfolie zeigt Abdrücke der empfindlichen Elektronikteile auf der Unterseite der Festplatten. Ich bin sprachlos und hätte eigentlich durch die unzähligen Rezensionen gewarnt sein sollen; immerhin, alle anderen Teile, die ich für den Aufbau meines neuen PC's benötigt hatte (Wert 1.500€), habe ich, bestens verpackt, schon woanders gekauft aber die Festplatten waren einfach dringend....Das war definitiv die letzte Bestellung an Amazon für empfindliche Artikel!!Update 17.02.2018:Die Platten sind im Raid-1-Verbund im Rechner verbaut und sind schnell und sehr leise!"

232,Usuario,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bien. Punto. He comprado discos Seagate durante años, algunos de los cuales han funcionado sin mas problemas durante 10 años, 2007-2017.Y algunos en fechas anteriores que murieron por causas no naturales (sobrecarga de tensión o mal posicionamiento de la aguja), pero mi decepción con los últimos es grande.Aunque el funcionamiento es correcto, lo que no lo es, es el ruido. Nunca antes oí un Seagate, excepto cuando ya se había estropeado.Y al parecer, estos de un Tera, llevan ""de fabrica"" un ruido de lo mas irritante en algunas ocasiones. No es constante, no llega a ser incomodo, pero molesta.Mas aun cuando mi pc está configurado para hacer el mínimo ruido posible, sobretodo porque lo tengo justo al lado...Es el segundo de este tipo en el que me ocurre y preguntando, me enteré de que era algo habitual.En cualquier caso, el próximo será de otra marca."
233,Xavier39,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Le DD est arrivé endommagé. Linux-Ubuntu permet de lire facilement les données SMART du disque. Et le test donne des erreurs de lecture et des erreurs d’accès (leur nombre est nul sur un disque en bon état). Ces défauts sont dus aux chocs (durant le transport) à cause d’un emballage inadapté constitué d’une feuille à bulles de 2 mm d’épaisseur et d’une enveloppe en carton. Résultat : si l’on installe un système d’exploitation sur un tel disque, l’ordinateur sera anormalement lent. Par contre, pour servir de stockage dans un boitier externe, on ne remarquera pas d’anomalie. En dehors de ça, le disque est silencieux. La lecture se fait à 100Mb/s et l'écriture à 56. Correct.

241,Chance,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Drive works great, and it's everything I expected. Nothing special.I do have to deduct points for the atrocious packing of my order however, I ordered this as well as a single box of nitrile gloves. I received the hard drive, loose in an oversized box. With nothing but the antistatic bag and a crumpled sheet of packing paper as protection. HDDs are very fragile and need to be packed securely, my heart sank when I opened this because I was sure I would be returning it as DOA... Somehow it works, though it sounds rougher than my 4 year old drive in its operation. But for the $50ish bucks I paid I guess I can stomach replacing it once it gives up the ghost."

244,Tyler D.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  PROS:- Fast- Quiet- AffordableCONS:- Have to RMA my drive after only 3 months. Read below for details and updates.I purchased this Hard Drive at the end of August 2017. So I've owned it for a little over three months as of the date of this writing. This is the first time I've bought a Seagate drive for my personal build in exactly 10 years. I have mostly used Western Digital drives in builds because I bought into the mindshare many years ago that they were somehow better. After having a less than enjoyable experience with WD's reliability and customer service, I decided to come back for a cheap 1TB drive.I pride myself on a quiet gaming computer and usually keep it running 24/7. After about 2 and a half months or so, I would be sitting probably 2-3 feet away and I began to hear a faint but distinct clicking noise come from my computer every 15-30 seconds. This drive is used strictly for storage of files, photos, videos, etc. The OS resides on an SSD and there are no programs installed on this drive. I know this ""tick"" noise all too well, and it sounds much like a clicking noise that a dead hard drive would make. Nonetheless the drive works flawlessly, reads and writes fast, and makes almost no noise during regular operation. I thought nothing of it. After two weeks, the tick started to annoy me slightly, and I also began to get worried about the reliability of the drive. The sound it makes is definitely not normal. So I downloaded SeaTools and ran some tests. Every test passed but I decided to contact Seagate support anyways.11/26/2017 - I contacted Seagate support. This day is a Sunday.11/27/2017 - I received a rather generic support response, claiming that the noise is most likely normal, but out of precaution to run some tests using SeaTools for DOS (loaded on a bootable USB drive). On the same day, I created the bootable USB drive and attempted to run the recommended tests. But for some reason, my Keyboard and Mouse don't work with Bootable USB drives that well. I decided to record the noise and send it in my update, as well as inform them of my inability to run the tests outside of the Operating System.11/28/2017 - Support contacted me again stating that the sound clip of the noise I sent them was ""disturbing"" and recommended I RMA the drive at once.The RMA process is pretty straight forward, but as I expected they want you to send the drive back first before they send you out a new one. This was not an option for me, so I had to pay ~$12 for them to send me a replacement first. The replacement was shipped the day after I filed for the RMA and will arrive via UPS tomorrow (12/6/2017, so exactly a week).Overall: The drive is quiet and fast when operating normally. I must've gotten a defective drive and after a much better experience with Seagate's support versus their competitors, I'll be going with them again in the future. The drive performs quite well, especially when you factor in the price. so I've only docked 1 star for the fact that they expect people to back up potentially terabytes of data to send in a defective drive. Expect more updates to come.UPDATE 12/19/2017 - Received my refurbished drive approximately two weeks ago. This one is made in China, not Malaysia like the original. Interesting. It also doesn't have the cool Green/White/Black sticker on it. BUT what it does do is operate just as fast as the other one and makes no clicking noises, even when being written to or read from. Seagate just received my defective unit as of today and closed the case. Customer Support was courteous and acted swiftly to replace my drive. I'm a little bitter that it cost me $12 to send them a new HDD in advance, but I'm also grateful they didn't drag out the troubleshooting process on what was obviously a defective unit. Remains 4/5 stars.2nd UPDATE 2/4/2019 - The replacement drive mentioned above has started making constant ticking noises (""The Click of Death""). For now the drive can still be written to and read from (albeit slowly), but the noises that it makes are horrendous. Sounds like the arm is fighting against itself whenever it needs to sweep across the disk.  This is a re-certified / refurbished disk, so I'm a little surprised this is happening again. I have to shell out another $12 to get a replacement shipped to me again. At this point, I'm going to consider snagging a 1TB SSD and just accepting the high cost. I haven't had an SSD fail on me ever, but I've somehow had two HDDs fail on me in less than two years. Docking another star."
245,Michael A. Mast,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Ordered a couple of these to be used in a ZFS array. I was ok with the 5400RPM spec, but I was not prepared for the SMR writing. I had pulled an old spec sheet and it mentioned PMR. However, a very helpful badger on the FreeNAS forums pointed me to an updated spec sheet that reported SMR with a PMR head.These are fine for general storage, but don't expect great write performance."
246,Albert Armea,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  UPDATE: I returned the clicking drive and got a replacement because it's the only 2 TB drive from any manufacturer that will fit in my laptop. The second one seems to be working fine after about a month of usage.------Clicks constantly one day after installOne day after installing this drive in my laptop, this drive started clicking constantly - at least once a second. While it seems I can reliably read and write data to it right now, the clicking is definitely not reassuring. I was originally planning on using this drive to record music, but the clicking is too loud and will come through in recordings."
247,Matt W.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  For those who don't want a wall of text the first picture is the packaging the first drive arrived in, broken. The second picture is what the replacement arrived in, working just fine.-----I received the first drive in a plastic bag, inside an amazon bubble wrap envelope. When I plugged the drive into my computer and started up it made a loud clicking noise and my computer would not start. 'attempting repairs' followed by a restart ect... Left it for 6 hours and still in a restart loop. Tried force restarting and turning it back on several times to no avail.  Unplugged the drive and my computer started normally.After contacting amazon support I got a replacement drive within a few days which arrived in a shock absorbent cardboard case, and the same kind of amazon packaging as the first around that. This one worked like a charm.I give this 3 stars because the replacement process was so straight-forward and painless with amazon, but it amazes me that such sensitive hardware would be shipped so carelessly. An unprotected drive is rated to break from a fall of just 3 feet (1 meter). That's just above someone's waist, so unless they are toting these around on all fours, one drop during the shipping process may have been what broke the first drive. An extra few bucks to protect 100$ worth of hardware? nah plastic bags protect hard drives. (sarcasm)"
248,Mobi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's not a bad drive if you are just storing some documents and images. I've used Seagate for years and haven't had bad experiences with their products. However, I bought this drive because of the price per TB for Burstcoin mining. The only complaint I have about this drive is that its write speed is VERY slow. It took a full 2 days to plot the entire 4TB when I could have plotted a full 8TB on a WD external drive in about a day and a half. Now that it is plotted the read speed is pretty good and I expect to get a ROI in less than a month."
249,Arne,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This gives me a kick! Many years ago, our company computer could handle a whopping 4GB, and required four full time employees and an air conditioned room. Now I look at my laptop, and it tells me 1.81TB are ready at my disposal for this disk alone. (That's what is the ""true"" space it provides).It was a breeze to install, is whisper-quiet, and runs cool. It is noticeably faster then the 750GB H!t@$hi it replaced. I boot from an SSD, so this one is just for storage. As a photographer always shooting RAW format, I was always low on space. This gives me ample, for now.OEM, it doesn't come with anything but the drive, but it isn't supposed to ether.Packaging was excellent, and had to be the way it was handled before getting here. I will update if anything bad were to happen.Always backup your precious data, for 1.81TB is a lot of stuff to loose!Update:After exactly one year and two months, the hard drive is emitting an increasing number of anxious beeps, letting me know it is unhappy..."
250,Sev,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Surprised that it died just about a year later after I got it. One day it just started making a noise and I thought it was maybe cable being loose or something. I reconnected things and things ran ok for a little and then it just totally died. No matter what I tried it would not come back to life. Good thing all my files are always saved on my NAS, never locally. I only used this drive for my local games to be installed so no files lost. I contacted Seagate to get a replacement. Stuff dies so yeah not a fun day. Not sure if I really would buy this drive again in future."
251,Alex,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ran this drive for about a year in my media server. It held the OS (Linux) data and transcode space, and it did ok. Boot time is pretty slow, and it also runs very hot. I’d be fine with the heat if this drive was fast, just seems to be the worst of both worlds, slow and hot.It sits in a drawer now until I can find a use for it."
252,Dmitry Z.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a good hard drive for what it is... The listing leaves a lot out and I wanted to make sure to put something out there so someone in the future can be sure. I bought the 4TB 256mb cache drive in January 2018. It arrived as a BARE DRIVE with no accessories. I wasn't advertised as a bare drive, so that was a surprise. Also, I couldn't find any conclusive specs on this drive's spindle speed and decided to chance it- mistake. This is a 5400RPM drive. My NAS is detecting 5425 rpm to be specific. All my other hard drives are 7200rpm, so I can't use it to replace a dying drive in a RAID array and have to use it on its own."
253,K. Eckert,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  So far works great but it is by far the loudest hard drive I have ever used in a laptop.  Constant tick, tick, tick sounds while I run my video editing software.  I have owned 3 Dell Inspirions Laptops, all their harddrives were very quiet.  After six years the hard drive crashed on my latest Inspirion 15R."
254,Doge,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let's get some things straight, this is the 2017 version which people confuse with the 2016 version. The read speed is more than acceptable but the write is atrocious even for a drive in it's category. The sequential Read is averaging about 180MB/s for me and the sequential write is 80 to 90MB/s.Lets talks pros:-Quiet-Slim for a 3.5"" drive-works great for MMO's and Storage-Seagate tools software is nice.Cons:-Slow write speed-You'll notice micro stutters in certain FPS games and a very unoptimized game like ""Escape from Tarkov"" is nearly unplayable. Took me about 10 minutes to load into a map.In conclusion, I'm returning this because similar drives such as WD blue 5400rpm perform better in sequential writes. By the way this hard drive is not 7200rpm, it's 5900rpm. Attached is my crystal disk benchmark."
255,Taylor S Mefford,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Seagate 4TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 256MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive (ST4000DM004)

The 4GB regular Hard drive (NOT the PRO) is listed as a 7,200 rpm. However, after examining it, it appears to run at 5,400 not 7,200.Unfortunately, I did not realize this until I already had tons of files in place. So, too late for me to return it. Just be aware."
256,One_love_0725,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Purchased this for a camera set and only got about 7 months out of it.  It would shut my system down after recording for a while. I would not recommend this hard drive if your looking for long time use.
257,Daniel C.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I bought this Hard drive, I bought it with the understanding that it was a 7200 RPM speed. I remember that's exactly what it said on the description, and it was one of the deciding factors. I get it shipped, finally get it installed after the work week, and its 5400 RPM. It was not as advertised. I don't know if it was a typo, false advertising or what, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm disappointed."

The first one burned out as soon as it was installed, the 2nd stopped spinning 30 minutes into transferring data and this one up to this point has worked perfectly....Thank you Amazon for your diligience on this"
263,Daniel Ruiz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its a good drive but not for my needs, i found out after the fact that the 4tb version is 5400rpm(the description says 7200tpm for some reason, but pay attention to the cache. Bigger than 128mb cache is most likely 5400rpm), im not sure of the rest but i had to return it and get a barracuda pro, also doesnt come with sata cable."
264,Chris,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  First one either broke after the first initialization or just came broken, but the replacement is working fine. So, keep in mind that you might have to send it back and get a replacement."
265,Xtoffer B.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Was good at first but catastrophicly failed in less than a year.  Lost all 2TB of data,  pictures,  documents,  movies,  music,  everything. Gone.  Unrecoverable,  even by Seagate in-house recovery service.  Good drive but get the data recovery insurance when you buy,  just in case.  Better safe than sorry like me."
266,Rowndy,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  uno me salio bueno y el otro malo la garantia es muy corta, no me aparece la opcion de devolucion y lo compre en febrero"
267,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had one of these fail after about 6 months, and another after about a year and a half. Just spend the extra money for HGST."
268,Rad,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  There were unexplained installation issues
269,Thomas Blackwell,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  arrived on time but wasn't what I wanted so I returned it
270,KingsmanAMZ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:CompactPretty huge buffer sizeCons:Amazon tech specs didn't match the actual product, such as the device model code, and most importantly it was showing 7200rpm, actual product is only 5400rpm. (Might be planning on returning it)"
271,Pretty Pink,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disk started making noise in a few days after installation. Makes me wonder, how quickly this is going to fail."
272,Sean Godinez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Haven’t used it yet because the description does not notify customers that the drive does not come with cables or screws...would be nice to know. Now I can’t install or use it until I order a sata cable and screws. Disappointed
273,lawrenc jones,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It went belly up in my NAS system after 3 months
274,Joseph Lane,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It said nothing about 400GB used for external means. Not as described.
275,Travis Ehlers,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Information on this drive was pretty mediocre.. Drive is only 5400 RPM. Drive works great for what it is. Seems to be pretty good. It makes a light hum but definitely not as bad as most. Much quieter than I was expecting for sure. Giving 3 stars due to lack of information in item description and people answering questions wrong in the Q&A section without anyone correcting it.
276,Joshua,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  works
277,Christopher,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1 hard drive worked well in ps4, the other only worked for a day,not pleased with second one"

280,Matthew,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I like the hard drive. I didn't realize I was paying American dollars for it. If I knew that I would've bought it locally as I reside in Canada.
281,jas,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The drive has a lag in Win 10.
282,Vernon Kilburg,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This drive is some what of a disappointment and initially I thought I was going to need to return it... The drive appeared to be in perfect condition and whatever the issue was when the os was installed happened upon installation... There was never an issue with the pc prior to the HD  beginning to fail when I installed this one in its place and in the beginning the installation took longer than expected...When complete the os had a bunch of driver issues that never happened on the machine which the restore discs were directly created from so it was most likely caused by the formatted seagate drive which I guess I should have reformatted it since the drive may have been sitting for a while... Anyway the other reason for 3 stars is the drive is creating a low tone on the mic that is quite significant when mic is turned off at the mic it can be heard and fluctuates when it is accessing data... the drive is as a 7 year old Hitachi 500mb which is because the Hitachi  did spin at a higher rate then this but it was my understanding that the formatting of the disk and the advances in tech that this drive should be faster and its not...
283,Kate J.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered one of these to replace the failing drive in my 2012 MacBook Pro. Upon install, I heard a clicking noise at fairly regular intervals. I’ve spent enough time around computers to know what a hard drive should NOT sound like. Clicking isn’t good.I installed the OS and my drive testing software and tested it out. Two failures. Seek and read testing failed. The drive arrived faulty.I gave three stars instead of one because:1. Amazon is shipping out a replacement2. Drive was easy to installIf the replacement arrives and is a dud then I’ll change my rating."

291,Carlos Acosta,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its ok, but its performance its not as Seagate promises"
292,Bradley P,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mistakenly bought this instead of a firecuda for a NUC, This drive gets the job done and for most it will probably be more than enough!I however didn't care for it as a boot drive. My NUC was originally a gaming PC that used TB3 to an EGPU and I promptly replaced it with an SSD. After turning my NUC into an HTPC I threw this drive back into the NUC and while this drive was able to function without buffering, stuttering, and a clear 1080P picture I didn't care for read write speeds of about 60 MBPS. This drive is GREAT in a 2.5"" enclosure though, even on my NUC HTPC for some extra storage."
293,Kit Starke,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It stopped working after 3 months.
294,Jose Luna,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It was working well at first until the second day that I received a blue screen cause of the drive. I was able to repair it until I had problems with it again. I have tried calling Seagate but sends me straight to voicemail.

0,Chintan,Zero Noise Cancellation - Rest is good,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review after using for 1 month:Pros:1. The sound quality is amazing if you are sitting in a quite environment.2. Extremely light weight.3. Charging case can charge them for 4 times.4. Fits most of the ears, please go to nearest apple store, try them for 20-25 mins, if you feel comfortable then only buy.5. Great voice quality and highly convenient for long calls. You can do all your chores while talking with friends/family.Cons:1. Zero Noise cancellation2. The case gets in 2-3 days of normal use3. Not good for workout (running, gymming, training, etc)4. Obviously, overpriced."
1,Gagandeep,Good earphones but not stellar,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The particular piece received has a slightly loose hinge on the case. I have used the previous generation Airpods for 2 years and there was no issue. I guess the quality levels have fallen. Apple India has refused to accept this as a warranty issue.Sound quality is good and same as Airpods from 1st gen.There is no noise cancelling feature for that you will need to look at the Airpods proand shell out extra doughIt pairs much faster with devices as compared to last generation Airpods and “hey Siri” feature is great.Expect a lifetime of slightly over 2 years as the battery starts to wear out and there is no way to replace the battery in the budsOverall a good earphones but with some flaws
2,Tushar Sahoo,Experience is so so... not that great,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It instantly connects to the IPhone and Mac. However toggling between Mac and iPhone is not that seamless. In my second day I had a hard time connecting back to my iPhone when I disconnected from Mac. It showed AirPod is connected to the iPhone but no sound either music or call. I had to reboot iPhone and connect again. Never expected this from an Apple AirPod. But sound is good for making calls and it doesn’t fall off from your ears.
3,Mohit Tripathi,"Not Good, as per price",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  as pe that’s price, product are not good. For bass lover, it is ‘Bakwas’. this is comfortable for talk and always wear in office. sound quality is Ok Ok, you can take realme buds air also, only that’s calling time is only 01 hour. otherwise it is great."
4,Anup Dhal,Worth of buying.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I didn't even expected good sound quality. Sound is good. in my case I got the defect product. both the left and right earpods were not pairing with each other and I was getting continues blinks with amber light. tried with the Amazon customer care, no body responded. Finally I had to return this product and now I have purchased from the store directly and using nicely now."
5,Koustubh Sangvikar,Good for office calls,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:1. Good sound2. Noise cancellation is good3. Good for office calls, listening music while driving, or walkingCons:1.

6,Kingsley Bar,"Good, warranty issues",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this product a year back, and now its stopped functioning.Advise not to buy product online, as invoice does not contain serial no of device, which creates issues when claiming warranty.Have given a request to amazon to update the invoice with serial no, which is pending."

9,Priyank,Received a defective product!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have used Airpods in the past and could say that they are the best companion for your Apple family. However, the Airpods that I received were defective. While playing music on them the audio decreases automatically to less than 50% and I have to manually adjust it to bring it to the optimum level. Have raised a replacement request for the same. Hope I get the correct item this time."
10,Chaitanya,No battery life,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Battery life doesn’t stay for at least 1 full day even after charging with 100% battery life. Some unknown sound comes from left pod while making phone conversations.On a whole unsatisfied with the purchase.

72,Sourajit ghoshal,Two Years LIFE for 15k?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its a LONG TERM review!! So read till the END.It will LAST FOR TWO YEARS.It was bought by me in Aug 2018. Yes, 2 years back. It was my third apple product, after iPhone 7, and watch series 3. About the product:1.Design: 3.5/5.  >>2. Build 4/5.  >>3.Audio Quality: 3.5/5.  >>4.Bluetooth Connectivity: 4.5/55.Battery: 4/5  >>6.Noise Cancellation: 3/5  >>7.Longevity:2/5All good. But the BIGGEST ISSUE. Since its so compact, its battery is compact as well. So it started after around 1 year, 8 months after purchase the BATTERY started getting drained badly.And now exactly after 2 years, it lasts for around 75mins. the battery can not be replaced. So it has a life of 24months max. So if you are willing to pay 13k(i had paid 15k) for a headphone that lasts 2 years, its a GREAT BUY.Seamless connectivity across the Apple ecosystem, and great Bluetooth connectivity. When it was new it gave around 4hrs of backup in one charge."
73,Sharad,Close to perfect !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been a daily user of AirPods pas 2 and a half year . I am not an audiophile but I have an issue with all headphone and earphones use if it’s more than an hour . AirPods have such good design that I never felt an issue . Sound quality is close to awesome , I mean it is best that one could expect from a open set of earphones . This can be used as a daily driver .The only issue I observed with AirPods is its battery life post 1.5 years of usage . I have to get a new piece after 18 months as after a single charge they could work at best to 30 minutes which is not at all acceptable . After spending huge amount one would expect atleast 1 hour of use post one full charge ( only earbuds , not case ). At present Apple doesn’t has a battery or earbud replacement program . The cost of replacing two earbuds is same as buying a new one . Over all it’s a good buy if you are planning to use it for 1-2 year . If you are someone who expects a long life from electronics -2-3 years . This isn’t a right choice ."
74,SHUBHAM TANDON,"Nice but too overpriced, can get a better performance from Boat Airfopes at 1/6th price🤣",3.0 out of 5 stars,  No doubt the product is flawless but it is truly overpriced...it’s just Apple is charging for it’s brand name and people go for it to swank🤣 better go for boat earphones you will find better bass at 1/6 price

79,Kanwar Anand,AFTER 21 DAYS. VIDEO REVIEW.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"   I have been using the Bose Qc35 for about 5 months and I really like that. So I never thought about getting the Airpods. But someone gifted me the Airpods so here's a quick unboxing of the Airpods and my review. Please Note : when I was unboxing I thought it was the first gen, so ignore that speech in the video.In the box you will find airpods, airpods case/charging/holding case and a lightning cable.Biggest Plus -- Very compact and portable. Keep it in your pockets or bag.- Easy to Spot thanks to the white even if it is sitting in a pile of other things- The battery life is excellent and I have never run out of it- Good for using for 2-3 hours with very little listener fatigue- Works when I am running on treadmill or working out with weights- Connects very good with Airpods- Picks up my macbook fast- Good handsfree controls such as hey siri and skipping song- Good for summer/winter both. Bose Qc35 is painful to wear in the summer sun.- BIGGEST POSITIVE - Audio Sync is always on point without audio lag. The Bose Qc35 often has an audio lag and has to be connected / resynced- I have never run out of battery in the last month. The mechanism of putting airpods into airpods case ensures your airpods are at 100%.Biggest Cons -- Awful commnication with my S9 plus (not recommended for Android stand alones)- This is worth Rs 8000. Not Rs 14000.- No Noise Cancellation. So yes while it is good for treadmill the audio quality is so sub par when compared to the Bose Qc35.- You can't afford to put the right and left airpods outside the case or you will lose it. Always place inside charging case when not using.- Not good enough for audiobooks as the noice cancellation is poor. I can't ever concentrate good enough. Maybe the Bose Ruined me.- I look kinda foolish with them dangling from my ears. But I don't really care.- It connects to just one device at a time. What the hell? That's not good.- When I say Hey siri sometimes my Macbook responds and my iPhone responds mostly at the same time. Two two Siri's is too much to handle. Apple? This is so silly.Conclusion - Good device but very expensive. This is not good for noise cancellation. Great for running though. Not good for audiobooks. If I remove one single airpods the music stops and it resumes simply when I put my airpod back. The connection with my S9 plus is bad. If you have this, you must get Apple Music. It works best. I have noticed the charge decreases by max 15-20% per hour. That's max. The volume is not too low or not too loud, it is perfect for 90% of people. There are probably 50 things I have not discovered about this airpod yet. There is a high chance by rating goes from 3 stars to 4 stars. I will update you all. I don't think these are water proof."
0,Swagat,Issues with battery drainage with Left airpod,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Super Fast delivery by Amazon and best sound quality on such an amazing product by Apple.Sound Quality:4.5(dont expect too much Bass as its not an in ear earphones the mid and highs are par decent)Build Quality- 4 (expected design changes from Apple)Connectivity:-5 Best ever if you are in the apple eco-systemdelivery-5I had two issues with my Airpod:-1- First time when i paired my earphones with my phone the left earpiece was not working.This was resolved after resetting the Pod.However i felt the issue to be recurring one and i had to reset it for 3 time during the period i owned this product.2- i started observing that the left airpod was draining at a much faster rate(don worry if you see a difference of 5-10 % difference as no 2- batteries are same) however in my case if right airpod was at 100 the left one would be at 35-50%.Also even if airpods were left in the charge case the left airpod was not charging untill the pairing of the POD with phone was not active.- Amazon CSR Promised me an exchange of the product a day before  however i was not sent any confirmation mail or any update on my cart.The next day o had to reach Amazon CSD back and then i was informed that Exchange cannot happen and only a refund can be initiated.// :( i had to return my productPOOR COMMUNICATION BY AMAZON i must say.I am definitely going to buy the product again after i receive my refund back but not from Amazon.Amazon is great but they didnt had any stock left and i don't want to get into this trouble again.I am sure my post will be overlooked and Amazon will not pay any heed to all the troubles and discomfort i had with this purchase.However i hope this somehow helps you for your next purchase.
1,Venkataramanan,"Buy these from an apple store, pay the extra cash.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Take it from me, if you're buying these, Amazon isn't the place....if your lucky you might find yourself a good pair, if not it's not worth it, the airpods just randomly disconect,  one of the ears don't recognize, they're all in an old firmware, and some isn't even update, I've replaced 3 airpods till now and some work fine for a couple of days some suck the hell out of your patience in fixing them, ALSO NOTICE YIUR AIRPODS PACKAGING, IF IT COMES WRAPPED IN A SHRINK WRAP TYPE, IT'S SECOND HANDED, AGAIN, SCAMMED FOR 18K! the original airpods come with a pull tab, to open the cover, and there are no creases in the airpod wrap. to sum it up, get yours fork a verified apple store, Amazing and Flipkart are verified re-sellers, they are trusty surely, but as the saying goes, ""Trust but Verify."""
2,Sammy Khawlhring,Will be good if it last atleast 6 months,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pretty good at start but become a thrash after just three months of purchase. Cant connect to my iphone-x anymore, doing every possible research to fixed it, hard reset etc. None works, contact apple suport and they say its a hardware problem and need to go to apple service Centre. The nearest service centre from my city is a thousand miles a way and i have to take a plane for almost 10k haha. Good job apple and amazon."
3,AP's product review,Why I had to return them,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  ProsGood sound quality, extremely easy to connect to iPhone/Mac, good connectivity range. BUT!Con1I have nightly calls, which last 3-4 hrs at times. And these didn't even last for 3 hrs. I had to return them in their replacement period. Bad at battery.Con2Airpods have never fit well to my ears, so I have been using earhoox to keep them in there, but I really had to remove the earhoox, everytime I had to charge them. And put them back, otherwise these would slip out of my ears.Con3When you are driving with a helmet on - you really can't do anything to control music, volume, calls.VerdictThese are like iPhone 3/4, which was predominantly marked as a business phone, because of its low volume ringtone etc, it could be a rumor too, back then, but that's how I remember iPhones then. They are much different now, maybe these pods too become more worth their price, with time. But not at the moment. They are good to take small 2-3 hrs of calls/music a day, in a office/home, where you know, you can recharge them again before your next usage."

7,Sherlock Holmes,Apple AirPods don’t work,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The product does not work from day 3 after just 3 uses. The Apple stores who checked it made an unofficial comment that we have received an used piece but was not ready to give it in writing . They tried to pair it for one more time and then again it stopped working after one try . I do not know who to reach out to for the failure of such an expensive product . Apple says they will not replace it and asks us to reach back and complain to amazon .
8,abishek kalaiselvan,Horrible battery life,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have 2 sets of airpods, the one I bought at the store gives almost twice the batter life of the one I bought from amazon.

14,Amazon Customer,Malfunctioning product! Horrible customer service from Amazon! Zero accountability!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this product a month ago and have been using it on a daily basis ever since. Last week, I did not use the airpods for 2-3 days and when I tried to use them on the 4th day, the left airpod was not working. There was no audio coming from it. I tried recharging the airpods and the case, but that didn't help. I tried draining the battery and recharging it again, but that didn't help either. The left airpod was heating up and not working.When I tried to get in touch with Amazon, all they were able to ""say"" (they didnt say anything really, as I was not able to get an actual person on the line, just automated responses) that I should contact Apple directly. What a joke! Amazon is selling an expensive, high end product, and neither them nor their vendors are taking any responsibility for it?I've seen that there are others who have faced this issue as well."

17,RITIN BAHL,Pathetic experience,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using the airpod just twice,it stopped connecting to any device.Then I got in touch with applecustomer care over the phone and they also couldn't figure it out and suggested me to go to the nearby service centre, when showed it at a nearby service centre,they said there is connectivity issue and after I went to collect it from the store,it again wouldn't connect .Now I have started doubting the authenticity of the product and would never ever consider buying any electronic device from Amazon and would discourage others too.I am still not sure whether my problem would be rectified or not,very bad experience.I Should have spent extra 2K and picked up the airpods from an authorized apple store instead,really feel cheated"
18,MOHIT BASRAL,Zero star,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't ever think that I m gonna write a bad review for the apple product, but after using it a while, I have to write thisEvery time I wear these airpods, I feel a strong pain in my head,  my ears got warm and hot sometimes extremely hot after using this just for a few minutes.I don't know why is this happen as its an apple product, which should be best in all termsTalking about the battery life, that's good.Noise cancellation is just OK.But the main problem that I am facing is of headache and ear pain, which is not resistance at all.It deserves a 1 star because I can't give zero star as there's no option for that.Really disappointed"
19,Mohamed,Fake retailer,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It doesn't for even a week.... It struck and the right AirPod doesn’t work properly
20,Jackson Joseph,Worst customer experience after contacting Amazon customer care,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have brought this product few days back and identified a quality problem with left ear pod. The left ear pod has  noticed with ""Sound quality"" issues. Since it's an Amazon fullfilled item I have contacted Amazon customer care to report and find a solution for it.  The first reply I got from the executive was I have to open a case with Apple for any issues related with apple products either from a nearest store or via help desk. After so much time calls and transfering calls in between a person called Nirletta attended my call mentioning him as a representative from  leadership team who can't tell his last name because of the policy.While talking with him I was bit surprised that was it me or him the customer who came up with complaint. His talk was so arrogant and not at all helpfull. Also he wad very rude and told Amazon will not be responsible for any apple products sell through their online shop.I don't understand what is the point Amazon mentioning ""Fullfilled by Amazon"" in their products if they can't take the responsibility and customer satisfaction on the products.I wan't someone to look in to this issue on priority !! I hope my order details and contact details are available in my profile.Thanks!"
21,Yash Saini,Think many times before purchasing it online,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have using them for long time but from last 10-12 days, I have been facing this issue with my AirPods. My right AirPod is unable to connect and there is no sound in them. I have to forget the device from my iPhone and have to connect it again. After multiple tries, it will be detected and will work once or twice and then again there would be same issue i.e., no sound in right AirPod. I have connected with Apple through their chat support and they have suggested me to wait until the uplift of lockdown. Although they have accepted that there is some issue with my AirPods. But my main concern is that the warranty for product will get over on 27 April and since there is no sign of lockdown getting being removed. Although they have given me assurance that after lockdown they will check and will consider my case. But it’s a big question, will they exchange or repair it or I have been just given a sought of fake assurance. I do not know whether it is a manufacturer defect or the reseller has given me the defected or refurbished piece. I would advice you to buy any Apple product directly from a store."
22,Amazon Customer,Waste for Android phone,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been trying to use the product for last 3 months. I was impressed with sound quality. It was far better than any other true wireless earphone in market. But this is not a good product with Android phone. Reasons below,1. Most of the time you have to connect manually by going to settings and blutooth options. Auto connect does not work many times. Especially if you have connected this to multiple devices then you always need to connect manually.2. There is no noise cancellation which is generally known but what is not so obvious is the loudness of the sound. If you are on road with moderate traffic then you cannot use airpods as the sound output will be too low even at the max level. The same thing is better in iPhones but in Android it is useless.3. Last and most pathetic - after some days if usage I am unable to talk on phone or whats app using airpods. The other person gets lot of disturbances and get very low voice. This happens in a silent room also.If you search on web you will find many people facing the same problem. My bad that I did not read those issues earlier. Just a note that I also tried all workarounds i.e. using single ear phone or absolute noise setting in Android etc. But nothing works.In summary - if you are using Android phone this is not the right product."

25,JAK,Refurbished sold as new,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  though the AirPods came in sealed pack, it was a refurbished one! As soon as tried to pair it said ‘my husband’s AirPods’ .

FAKE!!I bought it in great indian festival (18th oct. 2019) and it was delivered so quickly and looked great but after i opened it, it was so disappointing experience. Battery Life is just 10 mins. Volume of voice over its mic is so low. At first I thought it to be original But then After a few days I say it side by side with the real ones and I have to say it is the best copy available. It connects so good with android. Not for 12k but it’s worth of 1200."
27,Manpreet Singh,Defective,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  These stopped working 2 days after I received them. First the right airpod stopped working and then both of them wouldn't connect anymore. Total waste of money, would not reccomend at all. Not sure if the vender sent defective product."
28,Natasha,Do not buy from Amazon. DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. POOREST CUSTOMER SUPPORT. NO REPLACEMENT!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got my AirPods from Amazon two days back. Poor battery life, and not charging.I was forced to call Amazon support where they told me that they can’t replace and I have to call Apple. This is besides the fact that there is a replace option available under my order.I ordered this product online because it was a need for my work. Otherwise, I would have gone to the store and buy. I was avoiding stepping outside but well, Amazon and Apple made them self feel worthless on this account.Amazon asked me to AppleApple made me hold for 45 minsThen acted to troubleshoot by disconnecting and reconnecting my device to phone (god knows that consumers are stupid!!!!!). Then told me to go to their service Center.I want to just mention HOW WORTHLESS THIS EXPERIENCE IS and that if you’re interested in running round and round in circles for a simple REPLACE- don’t order from AmazonThey don’t know anything about customer care- they have a book- they read from that.... anything else, that’s not in the syllabus!"
29,Anindita,Fake and damaged AirPods.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  When it comes to expensive electronic items / accessories, Amazon also ensures that they deliver damaged and fake items.I bought these AirPods for INR 17000. It never charged to 100%. Every morning I have to reset the AirPods and only then it shows the correct charge percentage. This is accompanied by poor sound quality and poor Bluetooth connectivity. The AirPod doesn’t show up on my phone even while it’s connected. Even if you charge it the entire night, the very next morning it shows that you have just 15% charge left.Now, when I called up the customer care team of Amazon and asked for a replacement (I also said that I have all the packaging and boxes etc with me), they don’t even want to replace the product just because I uncoiled the charging cable.Can anyone tell me as to how can I check the charging mechanism of the device without even uncoiling oi using the cable?This is very shameful of you Amazon.I am going to post this everywhere, no matter what, so that people don’t trust you with such things going forward."
30,Kamaldeep,Fake product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Delivered fake product. Felt very bad regarding Amazon service and seller. Avoid buying costly stuff online.
31,Surbhit Agrrawal,GST Credit not available,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  GST credit should be available on all apple products because the price is too high. We are purchasing from company end for company use, but still not able to get the credit. This adds to our costs. Since, we are paying a premium for buying an Apple product which is considerably more expensive than other brands in India, then we should get at least some benefit against it."

After using same time the battery difference of both lid  is at 36% and 2%2. There is an annoying sound  (e.g kat kat kind of bip sound) every 30-35 second during call.3. Airpod got disconnected after 15-16 feet. I am even not able to freely talk in my 2bhk flat using the Airpod.4. It is not pairing with Dell laptop.5. Sound quality is not upto the mark at this price.Pros:-Good pairing and Connectivity with iphone.
35,SandeepB,Trapped if it does not fit!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  one star not for the product but for Apple's arrogance. They will not accept any return unless there is a technical problem. But this is a one size only ear-pod, how can they assume their design is so perfect? It was a painful fit for me. No support from Amazon, Seller or Apple. I gave it as a gift to my son for whom it fits and have to spend again on better designed products which have earbuds (and they offer them in 3 sizes) instead of these hard pods. I now hear there are many other people for whom the fit is not comfortable."
36,Sawan Saini,Airpods missing.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Packt recvd is empty.Only cable.No help from anyone.Dont buy.
37,udit m.,WARRANTY ISSUE,1.0 out of 5 stars,  i bought my airpods from amazon and when they arrived there was no mrp sticker on the box and the serial number of the product wasn’t mentioned on the bill. And I couldn’t find my airpods warranty on apple’s websiteI complained on amazon regarding this but they told me there is no problem on there end.Now after 3 months my airpods case stopped working and i went to apple store i had to update my airpods warranty date on there website and apple asked for the bill after so many problems I finally managed to get my airpods warrantyGuys please don’t buy it from this seller there is some billing game from there side.
38,Deepu,Worst warranty support,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I purchased this product in oct 2019 and had troubles with mic on both headset. I took to service center on July 30.  The response came after 14 days. Since there was no physical damage to airpods they mentioned that there was some liquid substance found in them. They claim this product to be water proof. Though the product was still under warranty but that was not extended to me. They said service can be done and each earpiece will cost around INR7000, hence it better to purchase a new one."
39,Aarti Jitesh Bhavsar,worst Service from Amazon... Dont Buy from Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Y day I have received from Apple AIrpod But that I get faulty after I call Customer Service they told me connect to apple Customer Care no. take Case ID i follow up all process after that they ask me Product denied latter why should i go to service centre get denied latter , after spending 17k amazon wish to go to apple & follow very very poor after sales service from amazon my biggest mistake brought product from amazon. customer service executive not proper knowledge. Surprise  I get  from apple  service  center  that is product  warranty 1 month before start while  I m purchased  product  from amazon  means I get only  11 month  warranty  instead  of 12 month. Amazon  cheat  customer"
40,Dr A K Vimal,Worst,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Battery is not lasting for even 1 hourAnd when I asked amazon for exchange they deniedWorst business policy I ever seen with AmazonI bought this for Rs 14200 /-I feel like I have been fooled AirPod is placed just like a toy in my room ,its not up to mark , it can’t be usedI m using my previous earphone that I got with my iPhoneSo plz be wise to chooseThanksDr A k vimal"
41,Shubham ,Faulty piece !  just 2 months after purchase left pod is not working.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Apple did a great job on airpods full rating for that. but I am not sure about seller? After 2 months of usage my left pod is not working, reason unknown. I dont have any service nearby so unfortunately I have to drive 200 km to nearest service. Frankly speaking  lf you are buying 14 k headphones purchase it from authorised store. Alteast you get surety to replace them from their unlike my case. I font have any option.Honest review guys!"
42,Tenzin Chodak,Poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very bad experience buying apple product from amazon.in I purchased an Apple EarPods which got delivered next day, there is an issue with the battery life of the left EarPod the Amazon technician team requested me to contact manufacturer I did so and they troubleshooted joke that didn’t help at all. So guys it’s better not to invest buying Apple product from amazon or any online shopping website, better to visit store and buy directly"

44,Anmol,"Not returning, fraud",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  incompatible product and not so good in sound quality,bose earbuds provide much better sound than this. When i ordered this airpods there is 10 return policy available now they are saying it can't be returned or not even replaced."
45,ashish,Faulty left pod and charging case,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The left airpod was not working.. consulted apple care and they confirmed my suspicion.Also when Paired for the first tym, the battery percent of chrging case was 78% and it dropped down to 30% within 15 minutes without even using the pods..The packaging looked all new however such faulty product has never been in my experience with apple.. don’t know whom to blame..  apple or amazon.. also wasn’t expecting something like this from appario retail"
46,santhosh k,Seller appario plz don’t cheat customers.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I have received a damaged product from seller. Where scratches was there on the product. After using it for 3days. Left pod stoped working.
47,vikrant,Defected Piece-Do not trust the Seller,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  the product I received was defective, the left pod never worked. Amazon asked me to contact Apple for repairing and then the whole circus started.Never buy from this seller.Apple took the product for repairing but did not recieve the pod so far."
48,Varun,"Phathetic, i think this is not original.....",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If amazon is really a genuine seller, request you to please change this product aa this a duplicate one.People cannot listen my voice, charger ia not getting charged properly, its nit even a month i have purchased this product and facing so many isssues...  Airpod is a branded company and they provide u such lousy product ?"
49,Amazon Customer,Bad Air... Don't waste your money,1.0 out of 5 stars,  It's an overpriced horrible product. Either it will not connect or if it does after multiple tries the battery will get you. I mean it drains out in minutes...the right pod just doesn't want to behave.Overall ... Just don't waste your money. There are far better products available at a fraction of the price.Apple you are a con company
0,Jyotsna,"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!"
1,praveen,Only 5 GB iCloud Storage not good!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are going from Android to IOS, You are going to suffer on few things:- Google provides 15 GB storage for google photos.- ICloud provides only 5 GB Storage and always ask for the money to buy storage as notification.- You will not be able to move or restore your whats app data from Android to IOS without using any 3rd party paid software.>>>Pros<<<<<- Camera Quality is Awesome.- Battery is OK.- Look is awesome.- Face Recognition is also OK.- Sound is nice.- Touch experience is top notch for the Android users.- Single SIM can be inserted and 2nd SIM would be eSIM and will have to visit Airtel store or JIO Store.>>>>>Cons<<<<<<- iCloud storage is low for photos.- Battery would have been better.- Earphone/EarPods or charger cannot be used as the sametime."
2,Shravan kumar,Avoid iphone 11,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Avoid iphone 11. Save your money. I feel its better to wait for the next iphone or get yourself another phone altogether. Apple’s standards are dropping year by year. But the price is instead rising over the roof with bad products
3,Ankit Gupta,The phone hangs,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
4,Adi,Ease of use is an issue in some scenarios,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too pricey,Gifted it to sister. Before making a whatsapp video call I have to call her first becuase sound of video calls is too low for one to notice. Many other Ease of use issues, this was just a practical example.You charge 65k for a phone and cannot provide basic things and annoy people."
5,jignesh gonsai,Highly discouraged with the Apple performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ..."
6,Imran,Average phone!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It’s just an ok phone with an Apple logo...Otherwise features are average, charging this phone takes ages, this is my first IPhone and I am regretting it...one may buy oneplus etc for better features and experience"
7,TheBuyerGuy,Just an average phone with hefty price!,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.Battery is okay.Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.
8,Denzil D.,Don't fall for Amazon Marketing. Honestly!,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.
9,Arun,Review after 7 months,3.0 out of 5 stars,  My review after 7 months of use ... battery health at 96%... that is mostly because I use a fast charger now and then else the health would have been at ~98%... yes the phone heats up at load and when plugged even interaction with the phone is hard as the temp go crazy ... never was concerned about the storage as I use cloud ... it’s fine ... will update his post later a year ... I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...
10,sameer shah,Iphone vs Android experience,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)"
11,Shaurya Khanna,Ok but not Great.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.
12,Jana,Average Mobile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Over a good phone but display is bad... my one plus 5t has a better display quality compared to this... battery is average , on medium or less usage will last for a day....

1,Sanjay,"Bulb is OK, the software is pretty painfull",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bulb is ok. There are no instructions on how to control the bulb using Alexa. The different commands required to increase brightness, decrease brightness are obvious, but things like how to set the colour temperature is a trial and error.The software is pathetic. There is no support. I sent a email and I am still waiting for a reply. It is some Chinese companies software and there are 3 different versions available if you want to change from the Wipro branded one.At Rs 600, it is ok as I got it as part of a echo deal. However, it is only a wifi enabled bulb. Things like how to increase brightness in the morning along with the sunrise is something I have not figured out.Overall it looks like a lot of work and software is not at all intuitive.If you can afford it then Philips Hue is probably the way to go.Otherwise do check the software which will come along with your ""Not So Smart bulb"" before you buy."
2,Barjinder Singh,Wipro needs to work on their app,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this product (12W) on sale at Rs.899.But it did not connect as I tried doing everything mentioned on their helpline like keeping it close to router, changing security setting of router etc. It would blink as they described but wont connect.I decidee to replace it but checked that it was not available now and they would only return it. Tried everything ans loat 3-4 hours trying but did not connectThen I tried changing the app to Syska I I learnt Wipro and Syska buys it from same supplier.It worked like charm on very first time.Then connected on my alexa too with syska app"
3,Sunil Nambiar,Missing smartness,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Initial setup and Alexa integration was smooth. You can change the colour, brightness etc. via the app or Alexa.Cons:1. Turned the bulb Off with the app, midnight power goes and comes, viola! the bulb is On! This is ridiculous, and Wipro call it a ""smart"" device!2. Every 20 seconds, the bulb changes its colour for 1-2 seconds!Conclusion: Wipro should put some more effort to make this bulb ""smart"" or reduce the price to say Rs. 300. I got it free with echo dot, so no worries.Update: After some r&d, figured out the flickering is happening only if the bulb is connected to wifi. If I turn off the router, no flickering happening."
4,Prashanth,Brighter in white color only,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  installed easily, Little disappointed with Brightness of other colors except white. Someone Used it before packed, some fingerprints with dust on the body portion, I think it was checked before packing. Mentioned no hub required to use it, but it should always require internet connection to operate it through mobile app. If internet connection fails, you may not operate it even you are in home and the bulb in front of you... Providing direct connection is important, it is better to implement bluetooth for those who are not having wifi in the home..."
5,Sanchit Saxena,Not that impressive,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Easy to use. Light quality is not that good. Even colors are also not good at all, only Red, Green and Blue colors are exact color rest color are not good. Even yellow color doesn’t seem like yellow. Its easy to use, good connectivity and controls, work nicely with Amazon Alexa and Google Home but still I will not recommend to buy this."
6,ritesh,Warranty? How to replace?,3.0 out of 5 stars,  There is no warranty card or details provided though claiming 2 years warranty.How to get warranty replacement? No help from executive.
7,Kirti M,Nice product but completely unnecessary,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a fun product, where you can change the color of the lights on your smart phone to creat an ambiance but I personally regret buying this because while it's a fancy ""smart light"" it has little utility. Only if you are too finicky about your ambiance and wish to chnage light according to your mood, then it's useful for you. Also it's not very bright. Brighter could have served a better purpose.  I will fit in a lamp with shade at best. The product quality though is good and it paired very easily with my phone"
8,Prabal,Not practically usable. Keeps turning on everytime there is a changeover.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not practically usable. Keeps turning on everytime there is a changeover. If you leave the switch on and switch the bulb off from the app or alexa, it will turn on automatically everytime power switches between generator and mains. White light is bright enough to light a small room. But Colour lights are for entertainment purposes only. Good buy if you have kids."
9,Samin Ali Mondal,Need option to choose default state like sonoff device,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great brightness. Response super fast. Great product.But I need one feature.I know many users says to store previous power state.But if i turned off via app.But the switch is on.But I need to set default state to ON.Atleast Developer can give us a option to choose, what state we want, just how sonoff device has that.That's it.I need that badly. Please.."
10,Rohan Dias,Great Bulb.. but not a replacement for existing warm light,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  While the WiFi and Alexa integration works extremely well, what seemed not to work for me is the bulb's brightness. You get maximum brightness only in white light mode. Every other colour is fairly dim. The biggest downfall is the yellow light. It is no where near to the standard warm white color. Instead you get a green tinge. It cannot be used as a replacement to your existing warm light bulbs. Wipro should bring out these smart bulbs in warm light only instead of in RGB.Also, E27 and E14 bases should also be included. Presently these bulbs are available in B22 base only."
11,H,"Not as smart as I had hoped, otherwise good",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Things I liked:* Brightness - good for 9W* Colors - good range of colors* Controlability - can control colors/brightness easily enoughThings I dislike:* Schedule is only for on-off, not for configuring brightness and colors* Scheduler is dependent on Mobile phone being connected to wifi to send it the signal... It should've been integrated in the Bulb itself!"
12,gaurav chandiwala,Not worth it - Dont Buy - Dissapointed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  As mentioned in some other review also, i totally disliked the following about this -1. Base colour temp is somewhere around 6000K. No option to switch it to warm white (3000K) or natural daylight (4500K). BIG NEGATIVE POINT2. Colour rendition is absolutely not good. As soon as you change the colour the brightness of the bulb significantly drops. BIG NEGATIVE POINT3. Even at the base colour temp of 6000K or cool daylight the brighness of the bulb is not up the par of a regular 7W. My earlier 5W Philips bulb was much brighter.4. The dimming feature is ok and works fine5. Dimming is not schedulable. Only On and Off can be scheduled.The app was easy to use and connect"
13,Ankit Pal,"A major ""cons"" mentioned in review.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros1. Can operate from anywhere in the world.2. Various colors options.ConsA big mazor concern is that, if you schedule it automatically turn on and off in some specific timings, during power cut and when electricity comes back it will continously in ""ON"" state untill it reaches at the next specific time of ""turn off"" state, which results into unnecessary power consumption, this feature makes this bulb looks ""dumb"" instead of ""smart""."
14,Danish,Not fully satisfied,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, I had to replace this item once, to get a workable Bulb.Secondly, whenever I put the bulb to color mode, the bulb flashes white light at random timings, which irritates a lot, when you are trying to concentrate. This could be happening because my replacement is also defective, but am not sure. (Since, I have already replaced it once, replacing it again and again also seems tiring. Thus reviewing it for the kind of product I got, which I am not liking that much.)Lastly, the Wipro Smart home app is quiet non-intuitive and slow, which makes this smart bulb a bit dumb."
15,Akshay C.,How to make it work with Siri ? (for iphone users),3.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.  Uninstall ""Wipro Next Smart Home, if you have downloaded.2.  Install ""Smart Life"", login and pair your bulb as you paired with Wipro's app.Wipro's software is basically just a licensed version of Tuya Inc.'s ""Smart Life"" app, so your bulb is by default compatible with this app.3.  Now tap on Smart (bottom middle) and then tap on the plus sign on the top right corner.4.  ""Create Smart"" screen will open, in there select the first option ""Launch Tap-to-Run""5.  Now select ""Run the device"" and in next screen select your bulb.6.  Now you will see ""Select Function"" screen, you can select whatever function you want and then simply tap on ""Next"" (top right corner)7.  Finally, tap on Save and you will see the smart action you just created.8.  Now tap on ""Add to Siri"" (bottom right), and select your smart action. That's it."
16,Rohit,Okay product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is great as bulb. But the problem is it's use as a smart bulb. You can just change colours or turn it on/off using Alexa. Nothing more than that. You have to download Wipro app for getting full controls of bulb. You need to connect bulb again and again if you shut down the wifi, which i find bit annoying."
17,Gaurav Singh,"WiFi Router is Mandatory, Amazon MUST Learn to provide proper info about the products.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros:Easy setupVery good FeaturesVery good lightSolid build qualityTech giant productCons:Stated in headline.Turns on automatically when current flows to it.I returned the product on the receiving day because neither Amazon nor Wipro stated about the need of a router for this item to work/start working. Wipro should make this item independent to any WiFi router. Rest is that you guys are smart enough to comprehend the situation.If you have an always on router, you have no reason to not buy this smart bulb.Jai Hind."
18,Sony,"Not so bad at this price,but better product available",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 7wattIt is rgb +cool white (warm white not there)Brightness -cool white brightness is good, but rgb brightness  is very less compared to syska and halonix.Installation - very smoothAlexa/google home- works perfectlyDurability - need to be tested, 1 month till now and working good on 6hours a day.Price- reasonable at the momentOverall a good product but not impressive. Warm white not there, can't be use for ambience as rgb brightness very low, utility wise good as can be used as light source in cool white mode and night lamp in rgb mode."
19,h1m@n5hu,Theek hai. Skip for now.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought it for my young kid to play around. White light is ok, but cannot dim the light enough in the white mode. In the color mode, the brightness is pretty low. If you reduce the brightness using the app, then colors are not accurate. 16m colors is technically true, but practically it is only a few colors.WiFi signals catching is ok ok. Sometimes doesn't catch enough. Planning to use the bulb as a WiFi switch more than a bulb, by doing some tweaking of the wiring. But that at a later point"
20,Vinay Hegde,Useful Smart light,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent product with good Wi-Fi coverage & the ability to change across millions of colors near instantaneously via an easy to setup Wipro App. The only thing I couldn't try was the Alexa / Google voice integration since I don't own any of those devices.The Only Con:The 1st thing I thought after seeing this on Amazon is it'd be an Indian product since the company is Wipro.However, hugely disappointed to see this is NOT only NOT Made in India but also imported with a discreet label ""Made in PRC"".For people who're unaware, that means ""Made in People's Republic of China"".Wipro Team: If you're reading this, please note I'll be 1 of the customers who's absolutely willing to pay more for a quality product 100% made in India than a cheap Chinese item. Giving a 3-star instead of 4 for this, do consider this as room for improvement.#StopMadeInChina #MakeInIndia"
21,Bhan Satya,"More of a party trick than a ""smart"" bulb",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This looks like a promising product with decent value for money. But for me it feels more of a party trick than an actually usable item for the very basic flaw that it has. When I switch it off via Alexa, it turns back on every time that the power comes back. It can be annoying and downright scary at times when suddenly the bulb will switch on after a powercut at 3 am. Wipro needs to fix this."
22,Harish Vemban,Go with reviews while buying,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a pain in the a** setting it up with Wipro smart home app. Even if you keep your mobile and this smart bulb on top of the wifi router it will still show failed to connect. Pathetic. Then I saw someone recommend using syska smart home app and configured. Myself followed the same and it worked like a charm. No fuss at all, did everything in less than 2 mins. So, advice here is that, if you buy this don't use Wipro app for configuring."
23,Abhishek,Improve connectivity issues and Brightness.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is not as bright as similar wattage syska or Phillips bulb.If u remove the bulb and plug elsewhere, whole installation process has to be repeated.Connected to WiFi and Alexa but never connected to Bluetooth.Since I got for free with Alexa under sale therefore can't complain much."
24,Bharadwaj,Good solid product but technology locked into provider's app,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Am disappointed because there seems to be no way to control this IOT product outside Wipro's own smarthome application. Nobody is going to buy all their smart-home products from a single vendor like Wipro. So if vendors like Wipro tell us clearly how to use this product with a Open IOT platform like OpenHab then I see value in buying this. Vendor lock-in through proprietary apps mean that people will buy the first product just for fun but will not buy more - at least am not buying more than 1 till Wipro tells me that they have provided drivers to connect to things like OpenHab
25,Vikram Shaw,"Nice product, but",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  7w brightness is just for nightlife, go for higher wattage unless you are using more than one in a room, also WiFi connectivity issue is there after say 3-4 days where you have to setup the connection again which might be a issue to some. Apart from that great range of lights colours, in 7w you have to use white mode for reading though."
26,Ebin Raju Varughese,More customisation options would be great,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good. I'm happy with the brightness and colour options. I also like the schedule and left time features. The only thing that I find a bit annoying (maybe a little specific in my case) is as below.I wake up at 6 am. I use the scene feature to customize a few color combos so that it starts with a dim blue and eventually goes up to a very bright white. So that the light slowly creeps up to my eyes and wakes me. The problem I face is that the cycle doesn't stop at the bright white. It restarts again with the dim blue. It would have been great if the app provided a feature to stop the cycle at white itself. Also, if we had an option to customize the time of a colour in the scene feature before it goes to the next one, that would have been great too. Hope Wipro will do a software update soon or will consider these feedbacks in their upcoming models."
27,sandeep,Not bad but not wowww too...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not bad but not wowww too...Am using this product from past one month ...it takes much time to reconnect... brightness is not up to the mark...works nice with alexa ... Need much improvement in wifi n Bluetooth connection...overall not a bad experience..got free with alexa ..overall rating 3.5*
28,Amazon Customer,"Good innovation, can improve",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bulb is easy to use, app set up may take some time. Light is not bright as expected. But serve the purpose for smart light"
29,Ujjawal Anand,Poor App!!,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The hardware is good, but android app sucks. Its slow, buggy, shows no disconnected device most of the time. Also if you can, please develop an widget, so that bulb can be controlled by just one tap from phone's home screen, just like a switch. And if you can't, please provide api/sdk, I am capable enough to do that myself."
30,dr.arvind,It sucks !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It needs a wifi hub. You can't operate it directly from your mobile and it's wifi. And nobody is mentioning this fact. If a person is not having a wifi router e.g. Jiofi etc, he'll not be able to operate the product. It mean you have to buy a wifi device also. It sucks."
31,deepak,Need to setup again n again,3.0 out of 5 stars,  First I set this bulb up in 2 mins but 2 days later it failed to work on my command.. alexa n it's own app says that it's not in network... I set this up again but 2 days later the same story happened... Might be a faulty product... I apply for a replacement.. will write another review after a while once I get the replaced bulb and use it for few days
32,rakesh,Good but RGB colors are not bright due to poor design,3.0 out of 5 stars,  THe smart bulb uses different sets of led for white and warm white which is bright and different leds for RGB which are very less in brightness. Phillips and yeelight uses  only RGB leds to produce whites and colors for a seamless light change and similar brightness.
33,Kavar S.,White is bright. Colors are dull,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product with good app support.....I just have 1 issue....It's a 12W bulb.... It's bright enough with White Nd Yellow light....But as soon as you switch to different RGB colors..... It becomes really dim..... Maybe like 7W bulb.
34,Rohit Srivastava,"Try any other brand, Wipro bulb is not smart",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not recommended. Bulb gets offline often and also does not respond to alexa most of the time.. and Alexa tells bulb not responding.. switching off and on the bulb brings it to wifi network again.. earlier I thought the bulb is faulty so I had replaced it once but second one also has the same problem.. so if finally you need to use switch to control bulb, you can't call this one as smart bulb. Try any other brand.. this one does not work smartly.."
35,Neeraj,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Brightness is low due to 7W.Limited colour options. There is a difference in color shown in app and actual light. 16 million colors is only theoretical. Still good one.
36,Saptarshi Sanyal,Good light poor color pallet.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bulb is quite nice for a budget smart bulb and has a few nice feature. The brightness is acceptable for a small room of 10x10 feet. The set up requires some patients. I have been using it not quite a few months and there had been no issues.However, beware that this light doesn't have a well calibrated colour lighting system like philips hue. The colours are extremely inaccurate and can't provide similar brightness in colour mode. Therefore don't expect the very best quality of colouring for it. Warm 3500k whites are impossible to achieve.I use google assistant and works fine."
37,Rithica Devireddy,"If you can afford it, it's worth it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good product if you're smart enough to know how to use it. The brighness range could be better but for the price it's a decent smart bulb. I definitely prefer Phillips over this but in India, looks like this is a better alternative.Make sure you get the 12w one, it'sthe good one. 9w one does a horrible job.Update : I ordered another 9w bulb and was very disappointed, my precious 12w bulb works like a charm but this one was just bad. Even the connectors looked shady. Returning it."
38,J C,Connecting problem with Alexa,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I don't why Wipro launch the smart lighting device without proper collaboration with Amazon Alexa while they are providing the Wipro smart lighting device as a bundle offer because after receiving the same when I tried to configure with Alexa I didn't found the name of Wipro smart light device in the given list and the alternate way guided by the Amazon technical support team so tricky that only a technically sound person can only connect the device with Alexa. I tried so many times but failed so unwillingly I decided to return the Wipro smart device.
39,Prasad Reddy A,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  During power outage light is not holding previous state(OFF).By default it is turning ON when power comes back. Alexa Integration and signal quality is fine.white color brightness is good but colours output is very less may 30•/. of total Wattage
40,Mr.Sunil,Its OK.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Could have been a more brighter.No problem using Alexa.Had problems using setting up for the 1st time with wifi but got connected after 10 to 15 mins.If it gets disconnected then you will have to turn on the Hotspot with which u connected initially then wait for a few time then it will get connected automatically.To change colours u need WiFi other wise the bulb turns on with the last color it was used.
41,Mayank,"Entry level smart device, don't expect smooth performance.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If it works, it works fine, but the sad part is, this happens sometimes.I am using Syska app as wipro app has many issues. Bulb keeps getting disconnected from wifi and the whole setup of registering the light in app has to be done again.When it works the color changing feature lags a bit.But the bulb flickers/flashes bright white light for a split second after every few minutes."
42,Ali Abuzer,Does what it intends to. No Bluetooth though,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Yes it is a nice bulb that indeed is a smart appliance and can be operated from your smartphone.• It would’ve been great if it also had Bluetooth connectivity thus not depending on a WiFi router.• Brightness for the 7W bulb which I purchased is not very much so good for a brighter option.• It can switch to any color available in the app spectrum but the scene’s option is just a gimmick and only changes random colours at variable frequency for all the scenes.
43,Kisan gupta,Smart bulb is off when we are trying to pluck in.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I don't know why but i could not this device with alexa. It is not working i mean when i pluck in it doesn't on. How can i connect it with cellphone. I have purchased it from amazon on 15th november. Having used 15 days i disconnected it. When i tried again to connect it is not glowing. There is a tollfree number given on the box.but it is not working. There is no email id where we can communicate. There is no customer care facility. I am really upset with this product..
44,5K,Nice Product,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  But need to use third party app to configure on Alexa,Other point is that in two/three days need to configure the bulb again as it just goes on blinking.You can still buy the product it serves its purpose."
45,Adi Kadiyam,Couldn’t get it working with Alexa !,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I am using it just as a normal light. It just wouldn’t work even though I have created a dedicated Wifi network with 2.4G channel. Waste of money if you are to use it as regular bulb.
46,Susamma Isac,Can't control color temperature with google assistant,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  One star deducted for not being able control color temperature from google assistant. One star deducted for false claim of IFTTT support. It does not support IFTTT, irrespective of whether you use Wipro or smart life."
47,Gagandeep Singh,AVOID. Works like a Strobe light when switched off.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Works with Alexa and Wipro smart app.  But gives off a strobe light flash every few seconds when switched off by Alexa or Wipro app.  Don't have the same issues with a 12 W Wipro Garnet Smart bulb I also bought.  Guess it's a manufacturing defect.  Advice - Don't buy.  There are better products available.
48,Sandip Biswas,Total loss,3.0 out of 5 stars,  After 7 days light is not working... Call wipro customer care.. But still now no response
49,Dhriti,Nice but improvement needed,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bulb is nice. Does it's job. But One must have two smartphone if wifi router is not there. Also coloured light in not satisfactory, specially the green comes out as yellowish light. Yet to explore many automated feature. So can't say about that"
50,boney,not bad,3.0 out of 5 stars,  it needs a independent wifi networkplease buy if you have a wifi connection at your homeothers don't*nd there is no color temperature  adjustment*not brighter in color mode (around 250 lms)
51,Devesh Bhattacharya,Very difficult to configure,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The instructions that come with it simply suck. It was very difficult to configure. It gets reset to default if switch is accidentally switched on and off twice. You need atleast two phones, one as the hotspot and other to operate the light."
52,Sahil Shyam,GOOD BUT TAKES TO MUCH TIME To RECONNECT TO WIFI DEVICE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bulb really works but it's good for them who has wifi and inverter bcz it needs wifi anytime. If it disconnects due to power supply cut or the distancing the wifi device, it will create a lot of work to you.It doesn't connect wifi automatically whenafter the wifi disconnects automatically. And takes to much time to connect it again after blinking the bulb, so it also creates irritation."
53,Bharath S,Wipro software issues !!,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I had everything correct to setup the device but .. it was setting up 100% and at the end showing “not able to find the device “ I hav tried over 10 times ... thn at the end it connected to the app of its own !!But Alexa connectivity was too easy and fast !!At the end it was all good .... but software issues must be fixed by wipro !!
54,Gangaram,When the light dimmed it started blinking in regular interval,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good and it worked simply however, when I set it to. If hat lamp mode it behave weirdly . It started blinking in regular interval. Sometimes the colour got changed automatically and blinked . I returned the product . If it worked as expected it would have been a good deal"
55,RAMADAS PILLAI,Works ok,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Color not as depicted. Mainly you get four colours, rest difficult to differentiate. So for working without any issues. Can be controlled remotely if WiFi connected."
56,Sam,Needs improvement and also should have an offline feature,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It doesn’t have as many colours as it has been described it doesn’t change more than 7 or 8 colours the biggest drawback is that it always needs wifi to operate and also it should have the option to work offline. If compared to mi smart light it has a small warranty period
57,Rishabh Tripathi,Not up to the mark,3.0 out of 5 stars,  After 3 days when I bought this the prices of it dropped to half. RBG bulb has a very limited colour options and it is not friendly with Bluetooth. I will not recommend it as a perfect product but you can use it for party or diwali or decoration point of view
58,Vikram bhaliya,Good product.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It is connect easy with wifi.but brightness is not brightest. One feature is good if you have wife in your home.every one oprate from vipro app.good thing .
59,Ahmed Arshi,Purchase only if its your wish to have it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It would have been better if provided with remote. taking out mobile then opening the application, then finding the correct settings feels like to keep the bulb switched off."
60,Rukhshan Ur Rahman,Hard Time Integrating,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Had to return the product when I couldn't connect it with the Wipro app. Issue? Mine was a dual band WiFi router. I couldn't change the router. I did, switch the dual banding off. Didn't work.After 3 days of trying everything, had to return.  IoT needs a lot of time and generations to mature."
61,Raja,Worst brightness,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Alexa integration is very good..Wifi signal also good..But brightness is very low when compared to 7w LED light.Disappointed with the brightness, I planned to buy this for portico , but this suitable for bedroom along with some other light for brightness..I also ordered LED batten, wait for that also and I will review later"
62,Yogesh gowda,50:50:00,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Guys this won't support googl home n not that brightest but Better than siska smart bulb...so if you have only eco Device go for it
63,Vishnu C.,Not that bright (product returned),3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I found this bulb's brightness in color mode very underwhelming. After I returned this and bought a 12W Halonix smart bulb, the difference in brightness was night and day. It was much better than this 7W wipro one.I did not face any pairing issues at all. It was rather easy."
64,V3NOM,"Ok, Ok",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Firstly, i will say it was too hard to set it up. Secondly it had good white light but had less rgb led so kinda low rgb lights. Almost dark on any color. Making it all short i didn't liked it that much."
65,Sahil Chopra,Would Recommend,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pros: Alexa integration works perfectly. Brightness, colors and wifi signal is good for medium size room.Cons: The bulb doesn’t remember the previous settings when it is switched off from switchboard. The bulb flickers when it is switched off from the app but on from switch board."
66,Sameer mohan jamsudkar,Don't expect more..it is just for fun,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Don't expect more from this device..the color brightness is not so bright...Alexa integration not possible..as app don't have same function..but overall ok for fun..
67,Abhijith,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The product is not at all bright .. its only 7 watt.. white light is much better than all. It perfectly works with Alexa echo dot. I felt bad that it does not have correct warm colours
68,Madhurandhagan BhuvanVimala,U can buy if u don't care about money,3.0 out of 5 stars,  At first I was excited.. But now it is a normal light in ma room. So waste of money I can say. But sometimes it's worth it when I'm in a bad mood bad day. But a 120rs party light can also do the same as im having one
69,Rahul,Overall its a good but needs more smartness :-),3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything is good except one thing, The bulb can't be left on and controlled by Alexa only, The reason is if the power goes off and comes back online which is very common in Bengaluru the bulb switches on even though I had it powered off using alexa or the app.  May need that  smartness to be added. I am not sure about other smart bulbs if they work similarly."
70,Nikku,Nice Product with 3*,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good product. Works perfectly as described. But one con:it does not remember swich off status. So power goes off and comes back light will be on. So no way u can switch off wirelessly and sleep. This con looks like a major bug which puts product below par. So Three Star
71,Bhavesh Bhimte,Not working product from seller,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Well Amazon packaging was good but i got the item seal opened.White light brightness was bright but was unbale to pair with the app on Android.
72,Mausam Parekh,Nice but issue with Wipro App connectivity,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Excellent brightness, but keeps getting disconnected from the Wipro App ever few days & restoring it is an annoying process."
73,Kalpesh Shah,Average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Brightness is not properly controlled and other then white colors are not proper.Bifurcation in different colors are not proper
74,A Bhargav,Almost impossible to connect with Alexa echo dot,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product is good, easy to setup in comparison to setting up with Alexa echo dot. Very clumsy and wrong description in the book provided. I am still struggling to connect with Alexa even after a week of installation."
75,Sachin Raju,Brightness very low in color mode.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good experience with Alexa integration. Only in white color it is bright. If we select any color like red yellow etc, the brightness drops so much that it looks like a zero candle night lamp.If you want warm white light with good brightness this product doesn't suit."
76,Ujjwal,Good but less brightness,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is a very nice bulb for a great price...only the issue with this is its brightness is quite low when colours are changed..when you change the colour to any other than white it is bo more than a night bulb
77,Frugal Buyer,Good bulb but the app is not good.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A very good bulb with a terrible app. Wipro should consider making the app more user friendly and provide more features in the app.
78,Dilip Verma,Average product,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Light brightness and color option is very good but wi fi connection system is frustrating.
79,Vivek Tiwari,One works one defective,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I had high expectations of this. Ordered two of these. One worked exactly as expected. The second bulb just turned on and off permanently. It always does same when we try to start. It also never tries to connect to wi-fi

83,SKP,Unwanted power ON,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It switches ON by itself, whenever there is a power interruption. This is a problem during sleeping at night.Otherwise the functionality is good. Maybe light intesity is not enough to light up a room. Additional bulb maybe required in a room."
84,suresh,Installation problem,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I tried a lot to install, several times but failed. Contacted wipro customer care. They said, software updation is being done,Pl try tomorrow. Today same problem persist."
85,Krishna Kumar,White light lux lower,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Low lux when in white light, lower than expected. WiFi working good. Light emitting area may be increased to get more light."

88,Srinath A.V,Works but need patients,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Had to struggle to get it working with Wipro app. Then struggle again to get it working with Alexa. Finally it's working. Stay very close when setting it up
89,Anil Kumar,Acceptable with limitations,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Some controls like scene selection do not work though Alexa commands. The biggest limitation is that it always turns on after a power outage even if the previous state was off. Otherwise good. It works with Smart Life app as well.
90,Prabhav,"Good bulb,  only get dull in Color function",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good bulb , good Hardware and fastest delivery ever.....Only in Color function bulb not bright as white and off white color Reduces the brightness like 4-6 watt bulb fro 12watt."
91,Daksh n.,Great but. Poor connection service,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The bulb is very nice. But you have to need another device's hotspot to connect it that was the thing i didn't liked. Overall its a 3 star.

375,sonal,Unable to pair with Alexa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hi, There is no skill for wipro lights in Alexa. Other than that this light works just fine"
376,Sharad & Tejashri Kishore,"Good product, however overpriced!",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The switch board to my room lights is not conveniently accessible from the bed and this Alexa integrated light bulb has made life easy when I need just to walk around in the middle of the night.The marketing team has done a misleading job as the colorful lights appear one after the other as per you choice however not at once as it is shown in the image of the product.There are other party light emitting devices which give better effects.If you wish to go for a voice activated light for convenience, this is meant your you.It is however overly priced for the given features. For this kind of money I would expect the bulb to sing a song or even dance for me!"
377,Himanshu kashyap,Good choice if you're getting it in 50 Rupees,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Well I got this bulb in just 50 on prime day sale but it is an expensive bulb, because all you can do with alexa is just turn in on and off and control the brightness in white mode onlyFor changing the colors you need a seperate app from wipro which will ask more of your information to sell that information and you'll start getting your email and SMS flooded."
378,Amazon Customer,More cons than pros.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This has more cons than pros.Cons -1. Not user friendly2. Stupid & outdated user manual3. Doesn’t set up with Google Assistant4. Can’t customise presets & colors5. Automation doesn’t really works6. Doesn’t have a web app so that we can access it from a laptop.7. Instead of Wipro garnet app, we’ve to install a Chinese app. (Meaning they’re just purchasing the bulb from China and just reselling in India after rebranding it)Pros -1. Very bright and very good low lighting2. Great colors3. Sturdy design"
379,vijay simon,"Integration is broken, stop selling this crap",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I dont know since the last update,  its integration with alexa does not work.  is this why amazon is selling it at discounted price? horrible...The device no longer is detected by alexa , I tried delinking and relinking the account , seems wipro smart skills is broken and no one is fixing it. it's been 10.months.. steer clear.."
380,Rizwan,Just a bulb anyway,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Came in a weird condition but it's working fine so I won't return it, installation requires u to have a wifi at your home, otherwise it's gonna keep blinking. Overall it's just a bulb nothing special, it's not worth the money in my opinion but if you're crazy over lights it's your choice, be wise."
381,Ajin George,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good but not the best... Only the white and warm colours are bright enough for 12w. Other colours are too dim resembling a 7w bulb... It takes a long time to pair with the app. Seems to be durable. I'm using it for 4 months. Colours make my wife's head ache... So only white colour now!
382,Prasanna Kumar,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not worth it as wipro smart home app does not support many scheduling features.Light will always be turned ON when wifi resets, many configurations features to be supported in wipro app."
383,Satyabrata Sahoo,Good,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Price high.  Software not is to configuration  quality  good only price little high. Delivery on time. Not easy to  h

386,Madhurya Sarkar,Disappointed with the quality of bulb,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The bulb has low brightness as compared to 12W LED bulb of other brands. When kept at 16%-28% brightness the bulb flickers. Rest the functionality is good when it comes to the app.
387,manish kumar,Quality,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There are need one dedicated wifi device , we can't operate from mobile wifi hotspot. If you have dedicated wifi connection at home you can buy this.then It's really impressive."

389,vivek singh,Not connected to Alexa...,3.0 out of 5 stars,  All ok but can't connect to Alexa....seems some issue which is still unresolved....so using it like normal led bulb....can someone help how to connect with Alexa so that all the features can be used.
390,Yogesh,Colours are Not bright enough,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Only white colour is bright, all other colours brightness is too low like a 3w night lamp. Not value for money. Invest some more money and buy other good brand's led smart bulb."
391,shiv mishra,Nothing great,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The effect is not all that impressive.
392,TK,"Ok product, worth for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars,  Brightness is not as expected. Colour selection malfunctioning and showing same colours sometimes. Might need to take it to its service centre.
393,Sukanta,good worthy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  im buy it onlt 99 ruppes in an offer, so its best buy for me , but for me its to hard to connect it with internet through wifi. Ist always need an wifi router or another smartphone for hotspot.."

409,Rahul kumar,wipro,3.0 out of 5 stars,  good bill quality
410,V,Good product if this had more luminescence and support for Google home,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pro:Build quality of this product is very good , feels solid.The white light is good , has proper luminescence.Installation is also easy with the Wipro app.Cons:In the box and Wipro app this claims that this supports Google assistant, but it never worked. Which is a big turn off.Coloured light's luminescence is very low, even with full brightness feels like old zero watt bulb.Conclusion:If u are using Alexa and don't want Google home integration the go for it. Coloured light is a big turn off so imagine Ur buying a white bulb with coloured zero watt capabilities."
411,Sreejith,Wipro dump bulb?,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Smart bulb? It seems to be a dumb bulb or is it dumb engineers wrote firmware without considering the usability? Ofcourse it has a lot of features in the app but it all becomes use-less just because the firmware does not remember the power on/off state. When power returns after a power cut, the light is always on. This makes all automation useless. I think a custom firmware like 'tasmota' is the only option."
412,Amit Banerji,"Expensive intensity adjustable white/ yellow light, colours too dim",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall an innovative product. The white mode works well, timer function works well however when in colour mode the intensity and brightness is very low (very dim output at 100% brightness). Definitely lower than typical 9W luminosity."
413,Uday Kiran Reddy Kollareddy,"Hmmmm, not worth of an AI product.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  After power off and on , it forgets its last setting. Everytime we have to give an input. It can't regain its previous state. pity bulb.But it's a worth of try(dont take it serious)If anyone really wanted to try, I recommend u to watch a YouTube video and get a satisfaction of how this works, rather than buying and getting your eyes blazed by the brightness of this eternal product ;-)"
414,Nivin Thomas,Fancy LED Led with Low brightness,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its just a fancy thing for now. We need another mobiles hotspot or wifi router to set this up. Poor brightness for 9 w led. White is okayish, Most of the oher colours are very low in brightness.We can set the brightness level down to 1% that's only an useful feature of this product"
415,Tosh Agrawal,Good product but useless,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Product quality is good. App is good.But you will get bored of using its features after few days and then feel why u overspent on the product.A kids delight in start but again it gets boring and u start using the bulb like any other bulb.Buy only if you have money to spare
416,JS Chhatwal,Light ok but WiFi connectivity issues!,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The smart light has issues wrt it's connectivity. It keeps breaking in between & even after integration Alexa is unable to control features like increasing/decreasing brightness appropriately. Got it as combo with Alexa Echo and hence keeping it and not returning it!!
417,P Bhashyam,Defect in scheduling.....does not work.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Although the app recognises the Smart light and I am able to control brightness and colour thru the app, the Scheduling is not operating. The light remains on continuously. If this is solved I would give it a 5 star rating."
418,Anand VJ,Not value for money and expectations,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It took time to WiFi connectAnd the brightness is not that greatOperating is not user friendlyWiFi signal range is low where my other product work well in that space.
419,Amazon Customer,Works fine but scheduling on/off does not work.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It worked fine. Easy to install. Didn’t use it with Alexa, accessed it through phone and network directly.But the primary reason I bought this was for scheduling the light, this feature is not working. If someone could shed some “light” on how, if scheduling the light On/Off is working with anyone."
420,vikas goyal,Just a bulb with many colors,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Its just a bulb with many colors.. white is also not that white .. with alexa you cannot change the brightness or change the shades.. you can only change standard colors.. not too exciting... so returned it back.
421,Dhiraj,Probably not up to the mark,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not up to the mark. Whenever you change the wifi network its very difficult to integrate. But overall its gud
422,Arjun,Low price average performance,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Decent product for the price. But the color reproduction is average. At lower brightness, red becomes pink, blue becomes purple and color accuracy becomes terrible.Apart from that an ok product for this price."
423,M.V.S.S.Kaushik,not so good product.,3.0 out of 5 stars,  this product needs to be placed very near to the wifi router. and we can not operate this bulb manually.
424,Dibya,Bugs are there,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Light is cool & meets my expectations. But one thing is annoying that the light blinks suddenly and that time no operations can be made with that. Switching off and on after a while resolves the issue for that moment.
425,Amazon Customer,Average,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is not work as Emergency light, or not as an inverter led bulb, but very good performance in multi colour changing."

0,Bharathesha K,"Not good, doesn't retains the previous state in case of power failure",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not good, doesn't retains the previous state in case of power failure. In case power goes off, and then resumes, this light will be ON always. Irrespective of the previous ON/OFF status using mobile app or Echo. This means when you are not at home, and power goes off and comes again, this light will be glowing all the time until you come back and manually switch off !!.Waste of money"
1,Mahesh R S,"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Anyone who knows enough hindi would know the 2-syllable Hindi word for ""let's make a fool out of them"" ... which is the typical strategy adopted by all Indian companies. And this bulb is a prime example of ""lets make a fool out of them"" strategy adopted by all Indian companies.Everything about this product is wrong! Amazon should have a ""negative rating system"", especially for Indian products, and I would have given this bulb negative-5-stars.So, I received this bulb around 11:00 am on May 15, 2019. I put it in the socket, and it was glowing continuously like a 5W bulb that you can get for INR 20 (possibly cheaper on Amazon). For the first time in my life, I had to find a ""user-manual"" and actually read it. Engineers at Wipro obviously do NOT know about QR codes. Or maybe Premji is trying to save INR 0.05 (5 paise) by NOT printing a QR code on the box.So, I read the manual, downloaded the ""Wipro Next Smart Home App"" from the Play Store and started it. 1st page: accept our ""agreenment"" with no text shown!!! I give Wipro negative 5 stars for that. Alright, I accepted the unseen agreement. 2nd page: give us your phone number. Alright I did that too. I waited for 5 minutes to get a ""verification SMS"" but none showed up! So, I requested a ""resend verification code"" and the app showed me a message to the effect: you are asking for verification codes too many times, so, wait for a little while!! What the ... was my only thought because I had just waited for 5 minutes to receive a verification code and you, Wipro, never sent me any. After trying it ""exactly 5 times"" ... I gave up and entered my email address. That was when they sent me the verification code. So, now Wipro has my phone number and my email address so they can send me marketing messages to buy Santoor soap (or whatever they make) and Wipro cooking oil!!After that, I had to add a room and give them my address!! I figured this was ridiculous, but I chose to continue with their flow. So, I chose to put the room as ""toilet"" and not give them my address.The next step was to add the device. The app said something like ""make sure the bulb is blinking, else, turn it on and off a few times to get it to blink."" I counted ... I had to turn it on and off EXACTLY 28 times to get it to blink. That is NOT a ""few times"", that's a LOT of TIMES.The main reason I wanted to get this bulb was because I want something that will switch off on a schedule. I have gotten into the bad habit of falling asleep with all the lights in my house switched on ... so I figured I would try this bulb ... and if it worked, I was hoping to replace all the other bulbs/tube-lights in my house with similar Wipro bulbs. It should be obvious that the first thing I tried was to set a schedule. It was 12:10 pm, so I figured I would try to switch off the bulb at 12:11 pm. The schedule page clearly says that the schedule will be implemented +/- 30 seconds. I get it ... this is NOT a real time system, and considering that most humans have a 60+ life-spans a few seconds here and there is not a big deal. So, like a small kid looking at his first light bulb, I sat there waiting for the bulb to switch off. The time switched to 12:11 pm ... then 12:12 pm ... then 12:13 pm ... but the bulb wouldn't switch off. I figured 1 minute was ""too real time"" for this Wipro bulb. So, I set a schedule after 10 minutes. 15 minutes passed, then 20 ... and NOTHING happened!!! The bulb was glowing like an INR 20 5W bulb that you can pick up at your local baniya. I had just made a discovery: THIS WIPRO BULB, that WIPRO claims to be a SMART BULB, is actually NOT a SMART BULB! It is a typical Indian, ""let's make a fool out of them"" strategy adopted by all Indian companies!So, by the end of all that waiting, I knew it was time to return the bulb. But, I chose to find out what other ""features"", if any at all, did this ""let's make a fool out of them"" SMART BULB from Indian mega-corp ""Wipro"" had in it. The only real feature was to change colors. And that feature only works ""manually!!"" So, you have to sit there, with the bulb plugged in, and your ""smartphone"" with the app installed in your hand ... changing between colors. You would have to be one bored mind to play with the colors on this stupid ""NOT AT ALL SMART"" bulb from Wipro.So, by about 12:50 pm I realized I had had enough with this ""Indian product"" that had just proven that I was a typical Indian willing to be made a fool of by yet another Indian conglomerate.Bottom line: this is NOT a SMART BULB even though Wipro likes to claim it. This stupid thing was a waste of my time and since I don't hate you ... I would recommend that you don't waste your time on this stupid thing either. Of course, if you just want to experience how Indian companies make a chu... out of Indians ... then you should get this bulb to experience first hand the Indian strategy of ""let's make a fool out of them Indians."""
2,Divya,FAULTY PRODUCT. NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I tried to connect through the Wipro Smart Next Home app, but it won't connect through Wi-Fi. I use only 2.4 GHz Hathaway Broadband . Such a difficult setup process and no proper resolution provided in the Wipro website. Lack of Customer support is a huge disappointment."
3,Deepankar Kotnala,This bulb will never connect to the app!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's just not connecting to my router. I wave literally wasted 1 hour trying to connect this stupid bulb, but it won't connect/ That's the reason why a 12 Watt (so called smart bulb) is being sold at just 899 rs!(Yes, I do have a 2.4 ghz wifi connection and the bulb is just not connecting!!)DO NOT BUT THIS BULB!!!!!"
4,RP,Smart bulb resets to being dumb every few days!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Would highly recommend not to waste money on this product. Wipro is still figuring out the glitches and this one has so many software/hardware issues that its not worth spending your money or time on this. In my expereince in the last few days, whatever setting you do on the phone app, it will reset every few days. And the bulb will be blinking constantly like a new buld ready to be paired ... Such sheer waste of money. And not sure what Wipro engineers were thinking to release such a half baked product to the market."
5,Satender prasad,Utterly disappointed with the wipro carnet  smart LED bulb.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  I totally disliked the product as if I wasted money buying this product. As it's been almost a month it is not connecting to my phone galaxy note 8 after countless number f attempts. I followed all instructions on the slip with it for its installation but useless. After being frustrated so many days I left using it as a smart bulb and being used as an ordinary 7 watt bulb after exhausting 1100 bucks for this utterly disappointing bulb. So I recommend not to buy it.
6,Rohan*,Quality not upto the mark.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  First time, disappointed with product purchased from Amazon. Very delicately opened package as usual, but some on LED bulb came out. Bulb still was working fine but impression was not good. Need to return. Photo attached."
7,G K,Not Working unable to connect,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Not Working unable to connect when tried to call customer care they are telling they do not have any information for the product
8,Deekshitulu,Started flickering after few months,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   I bought this in October 2018 and for the last few weeks it started flickering for every few seconds continuously. I tried to fix this by reconfiguring but no use. Other than this issue, the bulb is just awesome."
9,Manoj Ram,Absolute horrible support from Wipro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Absolutely a trashy setup mechanism. The bulb always stops flashing at 7% and the 1 minute after reaching 100% I get the message ""Cannot be Added"".I've tried WPA2/PSK AES and everything under the sun.  Maybe you guys have failed making a simple smart device or  it's just the piece I've got.Wipro has no live support. A horrendous way of discouraging people from calling their company. Absolute garbage."
10,Amit Gupta,Does not even connect to the app.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Its a headache to get this thing connected to the Wipro app. This is an imported product being sold by Wipro under its brand name. I had placed the bulb right next to my modem and tried to connect but it still wont connect. Called Wipro helpline and they said to re-install the app and try again but it still didnt work. Filed a return request within one hour of receiving the product. In this day and age when almost all smart home products connect flawlessly without any major technicalities our Indian manufacturers are still stuck in the age old system of making things as unfriendly for users as possible. Such a shame.
11,Shankara K C,too dim. Quality is not good,1.0 out of 5 stars,  rightness is low compared to Philips and mi bulb.  alexa too keep complaining its not responding. i see some dead buvs inside the light when i switch it on. i can't remove it. not sure how they entered bulb. i suggest buy mi bulb.  wipro is importing Chinese bulb.  so better buy good Chinese bulb.
12,Rituraj,Not a very useful product,1.0 out of 5 stars,  This is my second purchase of a smart bulb. First one is a MI Smart Bulb which is excellent in every aspect.My expectation of the Wipro Smart Bulb was similar performance. Alas this bulb is useful only in the default white setting. Putting it in Colour mode dims the brightness to 2-3 watt levels which makes it pretty useless. Regretting this purchase.
13,Raja mishra,"After 10 day, Warranty is of no use.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product stopped working after 3 4 days,  I was lucky that it happened within the 10 day return window, otherwise there is no use of that 2years warranty. I got to know through a friend that wipro garnet does not have any service center or replacement center (as told by wipro customer care executive) where you can avail the warranty, though he tried wipro cc , they asked him to  wait for 7 working days to find near by store where it can be replaced, but unfortunately they didn't show up again. So it's totally waist of money, if it malfunctions after 10 day return Window ."
14,PinSha,"If you buy this item, that will be your worst nightmare.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Alexa Integration is not direct, you will have to Google to make it work. Brightness and Wifi signal Average. It got non functional within a day. But the kind of support given by Wipro Bangalore team is very pathetic and the person handling the support is adament. You will have to courier the item to Bangalore on your own cost and wait for their repair and replacement. Toll free Madam will ask you to wait for the call from Bangalore team and the guy will tell you to ship it on your cost. Pickup request was asked but in vain. Never expected this from a brand like Wipro. Wipro Smart or Non Smart bulbs - Never in my life. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the item even after return window period due to pathetic support from Wipro."
15,Amazon Customer,Does not work with Google Assistant or IFTTT,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you're okay to use the device with Alexa or its own app then go for it, as it does not work with anything else as well. Also, the bulb drops brightness significantly when you choose any colour than white.Buy at your own risk, there is a reason they have dropped the price so low."
16,Abhinav Jindal,"Crap product, crappier application...",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Reading the reviews I was anyhow unsure about the product but I thought, let's give it a shot. After all it has all the bells and whistles a good smart bulb is supposed to have.The bulb has 2 modes, a Normal Mode where you connect both your bulb and phone to a common WiFi network, and the other one is AP Mode which you can use to connect to the bulb directly using its own wireless network. It's very difficult to switch between these two using the on-off-on-off-on technique as the instruction says.Coming to the application, I think it's just not ready to be in production mode yet. Feels like a half baked product. After installing the Wipro Next Smart Home app, I followed the registration process but the app just failed to connect to the bulb. Wasted an hour trying. The next time I opened the application it again asked me to login but this time it says ""this version of app works only is the US, China, Europe. Please download application version 3.9.1 or later"". This is irritating, I am still using the same version which I used earlier, moreover there is no such verison of the application for android available anywhere else.Going to return it. Maybe the hardware is good, didn't get to test it even after trying from 3 different phones, but the application needs a lot of work."
17,Rahul Agrawal,Stays on always after power resumes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Everything is nice about the bulb. While it is chinese make, quality seems fine and it works well with echo devices and wifi connection. Mesh wifi is recommended. The problem is when there is a power cut or fluctuation. Its gets on. Even in the middle of night, it will wake you up and you will have to switch it off manually. There is no memory function which is surprising as i use sonoff for home automation and it has that feature."
18,Godfren,"Please, go for some other decent brand!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  So we got one of these bundled with Dot 3rd Gen. Within 10 mins of use it malfunctioned and started emitting a constant red light. We even tried to switch it off from its wipro app but it was of no use. That red led was constantly on until we switched off the bulb directly from the mains. So the overall ""Alexa, Switch on the bulb"" or the Wipro app was of no use for this bulb as it had to be directly turned on and off from the main switch.Secondly, due to that constant on red LED, the white colour was appearing warm white with a touch of red and yellow was appearing orange and so on and so forth. The blue and purple area of the 16M pallet was completely out of range because of that one red led.Thirdly and most importantly, I returned it, got a replacement and voila! The same scenario!! The same red LED!In short, don't buy this stuff, you'd be better off with some other brand but wipro."
19,Pradyumna,Hit or Miss,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  A majority of users seem to have no issues connecting this to their router. Good for them!However, should you be unlucky enough to have any issues with it, you are in trouble.The app is sub-par, instructions unclear, and Google links non-existent. And customer service is not a concept that Wipro seems to be familiar with at all."
20,rejish,Useless app!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Wipro app sucks!! It failed to pair with the bulb no matter what all I tried.  After placing replacement order only I found that the bulb hardware is fine as it is pairing with tuya smarthome app. Anyway, the replacement request I placed was not fullfilled even after 1 week so I requested for refund. Nothing is right about wipro app and I would be surprised if there are any paid developers exist who support this app. They shamelessly keep this junk of an app available for download from play store. This is a let down for wipro investors!"
21,Manjunath,Smart bulb cannot be controlled from anywhere,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The slogan that wi-fi smart bulb can be controlled from ""any where is misleading"".  Nowhere it is explained as to how to control from outside.  Provision for remote control is not there.  Customers care no 18004251969 does not work at all. If anybody knew about 'controlling from anywhere ""  pl let me know.What is inside the bulk is not known.Please do not buy if you really want to control from anywhere. Only wi-fi is working"
22,Chetsj ,Don't waste your money on this!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been using this SMART light as an ordinary light since I bought it. Reason being that it simply doesn't connect to my internet frequency. Before purchase, I had gone through a lot of reviews with the same issue however there also  a few interectuals who had  mentioned that it works like a charm for them and had recommended not to read into others negative reviews as they either had not read the users manual or do not know to use theproduct... Guess what?? I ended up buying a regular LED for my home at 1k !! Sub standard product by Wipro!!"
23,Assam Hasan,Stop Working,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I got this product on 9th Nov 2018 and today is 2nd Jan 2019. The product is now working as regular bulb. It is now unable to connect to WiFi. Have to tried to setup the product again but it is failing to connect.Don't buy this product, go for some another brand."
24,Priyal,Waste of time - Do not recommend this bulb to anyone!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This smart bulb is faulty and it does not connect to your wifi/app even if you match all of their requirements (wifi, device, and phone all should be close to each other; 2.4ghz router etc.)I literally wasted 1 to 1.5 hours of my time trying to use different routers and phones to set this up but all went in vain. Major issues I faced:1) Does not connect to the app2) The user manual is very vague and there is no troubleshooting part in the manual3) There is no customer care supportMy recommendation-Do not waste your time buying this bulb thinking you will save a few pennies. Instead, spend a few more hundred bucks and get an MI smart bulb that is much better and has better integrations."
25,Abhishekh Chandra Garg,Various modes on App are worthless,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  When you compare it as a normal LED bulb it is good but when you will remember what you have paid then you will feel the following negatives:1. Brightness suddenly drops to 40% level when you tries to switch to various colors mode2. On its APP, there are various modes are available such as Party mode, Leisure Mode, etc. (frankly I purchased it to use in my daughter's birthday party), but highly disappointed. When you use party mode, nothing of Party sort will appear. Good try but not worth paying more for a Color LED which will be merely used as a normal LED bulb."
26,Rangu Leo,Read this before buying!,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Wipro Smart bulbs are not smart! they are just a bulbs that can be turned off or on by voice commands that's it.it gets pethatic if it turns on in the midnight just because the power restored. Yes! these bulbs can revive the same stateno matter it on or off it will turn on automatically if power is restored and this is frustrating all the time. So it is not at all serving the purpose of smart features or the power saving.Note: Power failure can only be handled in Philips Smart bulbs. Im writing this because I'm struggling to get  support from Wipro but no update or work around form them.
27,Av Rai,Dumb bulb untill it remember last state before power cut.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Colour light is dim. Bulb doesn't remember last status before power cut or swich off. This defeats the main requirement of a smart bulb. If you switch off the bulb using app and sleep if power cut and power comes again, bulb will turn on and wake you up. If possible please update firmware and fix the problem. I have smart switch which retain the last status. Otherwise bulb is ok. No music sync feature."
28,Manav Patel,Worst product ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Worst of its kind. It automatically gets disconnected from wifi as soon as I exit the app so you can't control it through Google assistant or Alexa as it is offline it won't function smart sence. The worm white colour is a most common colour and this bulb has 16 millions of colour but there's no worm white colour. So most of the time I have to use switch so there's no meaning of smart light so this is a dumb light not a smart light. Although we can't expect more because of its price range but it should work properly according to its discription. I will not recommend this product.
29,RJM,Dont Buy!! Pathetic!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   I bought it for ₹519 in Dec 2019. The product seems good at first. Tried Alexa but the device never worked with it. Had to use Wipro app. App  interface is not so impressive. There are modes to change the colour and brightness and hue. There some fixed modes of colourful displays ( very average). Now the main problem is it gets disconnected or looses pairing every week or so. I use it as night lamp so keep it on a dim blue colour. Sometimes every week when i turn it on it starts flashing bright white( thats its pairing mode) Worst part is it happens when you are sleeping wake up for something and you want a dim light.. You have to pair again, connect to your router and go through all the trouble in the middle of the night!!!!! No warranty information on wipro website, no information on how to claim it, no service cebter details!!!Dont buy it!!!"
30,anshul,Total waste smart bulb,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  One of the waste smart bulb, Syska is awasome.It's always giving me blinking signal and again integration with app. Limited colour function as compared to Syska smart bulb.I am using both , so I can say .Not recommended"
31,Venkateswar Reddy,"Waste of money, doesn't retain previous state after power failure",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've been using this since last couple of days. Whenever there is a power outage, the light just turns on once the power comes back. The light doesn't retain it's previous state.I have to wake up at 3AM in the morning to turn this light off whenever there is a power failure. Do not recommend buying this half baked wipro product."
32,165256,Made in China product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I dont want china product. So please mention clearly in description that it is made in china, it is only imported by WIPRO. Better i buy on flipkart atleast they mention country of origin. Irritating it is ."
33,Jatin,You are being fooled. The bulb does not get connected to app.,1.0 out of 5 stars,  To be very honest I didn't expected this from Wipro. They are simply fooling people and making business out of this.The bulb never connects to the App. I tried to connect with Bluetooth and WiFi following all it's detailed instructions.All it does is only scanning. After 3 minutes it will say No device found to connect and story ends there.Moral : You are being fooled. The bulb does not get connected to app and hence you can't avail the so called benefits of this bulb mentioned/exaggerated in their advertise. 👍🏻
34,Amazon Customer,You will regret buying this crappy useless junk,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This product is a joke. Define smart bulb and it’s use case? I bought this product to control /schedule the light remotely. But this doesn’t retain the settings if the internet dsl is down. Meaning, when ever your home power is down, your WiFi also down and the bulb resets its settings and and starts to blink. Again we need to configure the settings from the Wipro app. It’s literally a crappy product. Guys please downrate this product and wipe it out from the market so that other people will never get fooled by this dumb product"
35,aRSHAD,Light is not working as expected,1.0 out of 5 stars,"   I bought this light 9 months back. For the first four months it was working fine then it has started to malfunction and deteriorated its performance.When I raised this query to wipro they are not even answering and not responding to mails.Made a complaint on this to Amazon, Amazon refused to provide any resolution as the warranty has to be addressed by the manufacturer.So dont lose your money by purchasing this crap"
36,Kamal B.,Waste of time (and money),1.0 out of 5 stars,  connecting this thing with mobile app have so many hassles.Doesn't connect to mobile app either through WiFi or Bluetooth even after precisely following the instructions given in manual. It blinks and nothing happens after that...Seems waste of money. Though I'm thinking to speak with their customer service once.
37,Vaibhav Raj,Very immature product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered 3 bulbs from Amazon. Delivery was on time and I don't have any issue with buying or delivery experience.This is very immature product by Wipro. It automatically switches off and on even without selecting such option. I am running the bulb in cool white mode, but it automatically starts changing colors, going dim, suddenly flashes. Feels like developed by some school children who are selling it even without basic testing. I am going to place a return for all 3 bulbs."
38,Vinay Sharma,"You won't get any customer support whatsoever, their warranty is a false play",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Buying a Wipro product is like buying a Chinese product, once you purchase it, you are on your own with zero customer support. I have been attempting to claim warranty on my smart LED bulb since May, wrote 3 emails...never received any revert whatsoever. Called customer service multiple times, it hardly gets connected and when somehow you go past IVR, the executive tells me to wait 20 days for a response and I dont get any response even after 20 days...now I am trying to go past the IVR from past one hour and I am unable to do so...I hear that your call is important to us please stay on the line and then line gets disconnected automatically. Nobody has this much energy to follow up for a product of 800-900rs. and therefore giving up seems to be an option. Thus it is indeed like buying a Chinese product."
39,Ankit Yadav,Worst product ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst product. Didn't work at all, the replacement didn't work either (yes, I have 1 in use router and two spare ones didn't paired with either of these 3). So I returned it and hence got additional deduction. Never buy this product, go for something else.Suggestion just got an mi smart light - works absolutely great."
40,Amazon Customer,"This product is a gamble, nothing more, nothing less.",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Connecting it will be a pain in the behind. Me and two other friends I know who bought this spent the better part of half an hour trying to set it up. Once it is set up, it works exactly as advertised. Nice light, turns on and off with the phone, sweet. But if you ever have to reset it and reconnect it for any reason...sorry, you are all out of luckIt will not reset. Customer service will be unreachable (five months for me now). All the googling and youtubing in the world wont help (comments for all are filled with 'tried that, did not work')Here's my big claim;  Wipro knows this product has a big failure rate. Anyone who goes through the qna's on amazon for this product will know that. They're coasting on the one's that do work and the one's who just throw the malfunctioning units and get better products. It's their apathy to the troubled customers that is deeply disturbing."
41,Sanket,Faulty,1.0 out of 5 stars,  No idea on what was the issue.was unable to connect bulb with app.got the item replaced but still the issue persisted with other bulb as well.tried with multiple handsets and multiple android version but failed to connect.also wipro app is very pathetic  and very buggy.but great service by Amazon as usual next day delivery and other day replacement a well.
42,Kumar Mangalam,Worst product/service ever by wipro,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Worst service ever, please do not buy this product bacsue if anything happens to the product Wipro is unable to replace it, even if the product is in the warranty.I am facing the same issue.So Never ever buy anything from Wipro."
43,Jatinder,Not at all useful / no practical utility,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Never ever buy this bulb. It is not smart at all, pure waste of money as far as utility is concerned. I am not sure of other makes but this is true for Wipro make. Note -1. The manual says to turn on the bulb which will start to flicker (it will switch on off on off in repeatedly), which indicates it is ready for pairing. In reality, the bulb will just turn on and not flicker. You keep on switching it on and off till it starts to flicker.2. Now you have downloaded the Wipro app and installed the bulb. Every time you switch on the bulb it will show “bulb offline”. You can’t do anything but to reinstall the bulb everytime!3. Connectivity is not at all good as far as utility is concerned.Not sure of other brands but this one is a pure waste of money.  Try some other brand and write a review if it works."
44,K.Srinivasan Ravikumar,Poor quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Bulb was not connecting to my network even after several attempts.So bought another product from SYSKA brand tried today. SYSKA connected without issues. Hence returning Wipro.
45,raj,Not Recommended,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Waste product, people who gave good ratings don't know how to use and rate things.I used it for 10days and now it's not working. No customer care support for this product. Not Recommended."
46,Satty,Complicated & Bad Quality Product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  May be the product I received was defective or this is just complicated. The bulb flickered in the beginning, but then it failed to connect with the app and wifi. I tried with different panel holders and still it continued disappointing me. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, definitely not worth the price & effort."
47,Harsh Arora ,Very basic smart features,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  A lot of features are missingIf the brightness or colour temperature is less than 100%, the bulb flickers - main problemIt loses wifi connection very often, and the app is also quite slow.Alexa tries to control the devices, but is unable to perform the action in 1 go, we have to repeat it 2-3 times at least"
48,anc,dumb device+Mobile remote nothing else,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Alexa integration is like non existent. Almost never worked for me. Always shows device not responding. I have to open wipro app in my mobile, then connect to same wifi network, and tinker around the time left in the wipro app to gain wipro app based control. Even if the wipro app is running in background, Alexa refuses to control the device via voice command.Again fails fails smart device promise. Just works as a device with Mobile as remote for which 1 star, as it saves me trouble to rise from bed and switch off the lights at the night."
49,Rajiv,Did not even last a day and call center does not pick up phones,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am quite disappointed with the product. It did not last more than a day and trying to call the wipro call center, and they don't pick up the phone.Was very excited to pick up this product after the good review but was let down by the after sale service."
50,DEEPAK KUMAR GR,"Blip, Blips!",1.0 out of 5 stars,"  I started seeing a blip while glowing. Using it for a year now started to face issues like auto blipping and dimming which is weird to trace or troubleshoot the bulb.- No software issues found.- Installed both official app and Alaxa.- Tried reset the bulb/device and application no luck though.There is a blip after a few seconds, also noticed the flickering happens once it changes to Red.(Kindly help) How to avail the warranty?"
51,madhav,IFTTT not working,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disappointed as there is no service available with IFTTT as claimed by company.Also, I've tired using smart life app which is similar to wipro next smart, But no luck with IFTTT.If you are buying with IFTTT purpose I would recommend  to ignore this and better buy Philips VUE."
52,Renu Sharma,Received Defective product,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The bulb was dead and didn’t work at all.  Feeling something wrong with holder or connection,  I  tried different holders, but the bulb didn’t respond.  I had ordered two Halonix and two Wipro smart bulbs in ongoing sale, all other bulbs are working fine.  Requested return within half an our of receipt of order.  Return experience was below par as guy came for collecting was making unnecessary comments."
53,ksmkeys,Product needs revision/faulty product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  1.  The setup is simple enough for techies. But not so much for a layman.2. The yellow and blues are not rendered at all. Is either red, orange, green or white.3. At times if the unit is switched off (  via the app and not the physical switch on the power supply), it blinks on randomly in bursts. Randomly flickering anytime it is on off state. Unless the mains are turned off manually ( isn't that why I installed it? Because we're lazy and don't want to get out of bed ?)"
54,anishlalu,Usage,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Using the product as normal light since it requires wifi device for configuring using APP. Also, there is no customer care support available for configuring the same since it brought online. Should have mentioned in booklet or outside cover the requirements in setting up the product as mentioned on product features. Too Costly. If possible please share customer help number or details that will be helpful in configuring the same. everyone is sharing details of configuring the same with Alexa or google assistant for those who don't have these have to configure right."
55,kaushik,Horrible User Manual!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very disappointed.Was not able to connect the product to any device. Then later i find out the below.1. The bulb wont connect to Bluetooth as mentioned in the Manual. Need to have a second phone to be used as HOTSPOT for this.2. WIFI cannot be 5GHz. You need to reduce your WIFI strength to 2.4 GHz.Sad!Thanks,Kaushik"
56,Selva,unable to setup the device through mobile App,1.0 out of 5 stars,  unable to setup the device through mobile App or Google Home or Alexa. looks like there are some issues in adding the device to app. so this is useless

59,Mayank Arora,Disappointing Product.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Purchasing the product is Wasting the money. The bulb didn't respond to Alexa, Sometimes it responds to the Alexa but reverts back to its previous state within 1-2 seconds. Got a replacement for the same although the strike ratio was better, earlier it was ~1 out of 4, now it was 1 out of 2 but still it could not maintain its state for more than 1-2 seconds. So finally returned the product."
60,Anant,Worst!! don't buy it!!FAKE,1.0 out of 5 stars,  Whn i opened the box it was a used bulb and not even a rgb bulb it was a normal yellow colour light bupb with a fake branding of wipro. It was not having any feature of rgb lighting or even a yellow to white light change. It was a regular 40rs yellow lighting bulb. Worst!!!!
61,Krishnan B.,Poor product - glitches - fails to connect to all WiFis.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product never connects to my home WiFi (2.4GHz). All the troubleshooting steps were followed but no avail. After purchasing the product, I have gone through the reviews of this product and observed that many other customers had the same issue.I was able to connect it to my phone WiFi (hotshot), but it defeats the purpose as I cannot leave the phone to serve WiFi for the bulb.Think it's something to do with the Firmware of the product. Retuning it."

It's worth it, actually it's worth more than you will pay here on Amazon."
170,SidBookReviewer ,... i am back with another self help book (looks like its going to be a revolutionary year for me ...,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  THINK AND GROW RICH BY NAPOLEON HILLHello guys i am back with another self help book (looks like its going to be a revolutionary year for me with these self help book lined by my bed side). This book is a step by step guide to success. The first chapter start with desire then hop on to faith then to auto suggestion then to specialized knowledge and ultimately reach to how to outwit the six ghost of fear. There are lots of activities that are mentioned in this book, which one must do to get full advantage of it. It emphasis its reader to think and then take decision. If you are thinking there will be some quick mantras for success then don't. This book tells how to be persistent, have faith and what steps one should take in order to reach a most suitable decision. Lots of part is described with help of points making easy for the reader. Every now and then live examples are being quoted, therefore increasing readers faith in the book with every page he turns. It also talks about the qualities of a successful leader. Book basically tells that there is no substitution for hard work and burning will power is the basic key to achieve something in life. I would suggest to read this book really slow, understanding each and every thing."
171,Zircoz,The mix of reality and stories from pure imagination.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you are looking for a book backed with scientific facts and studies, this isn't it. You may enjoy and agree with some chapters and some chapters may appear plainly stupid for how they describe the world works.Nonetheless, it is a great self help book. It can teach you what to look for, in yourself, in your life, and in others."
172,Sathish Chandrasekaran,Good Quality & Neatly Packaged !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Solid Opening Chapters !There is no magic formula given here; it’s a just a series of simple effective thinking that has made millionaires who had only their dreams to begin with.The title of each chapter in itself offers a profound insight on what’s in store but it gets repetitive after a point.Some methods & observations presented didn’t click for me but the vast majority clearly resonated with my thoughts.Written during the days of the Great Depression this book still holds relevance in this modern day & age !Many points discussed by Author Napolean Hill is quite good but the most powerful of his observations were the effects of Strong Desire, Faith & AutoSuggestion."
173,Himanshu Jain,Good book !,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book is good but it is not very interesting or fascinating ! If you watch self help videos on YouTube you already would have consumed 80%of the information ! But you can find some golden nuggets in the chapters ! But for the price, you should buy it and read pages repeatedly"
174,Mohan Agarwal,Okay okay,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Some parts of the book are truly inspiring but some other parts feels like preachy, okay okay book if we flip those pages having preachy content in them"

177,S Deb,It's OK. Not Great.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I haven't finished the book yet, but you know what? I think I expected a lot more from it. One thing which is crystal clear to me is that this book likes boasting about itself more than anything else. And apart from that, yeah, there's SOME good things in it. My opinion might change later as I've not yet read the whole of it but right now, I don't have too many good things to say about it."
178,Abhijeet,It's OK,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Mid way into the book i was engaged, but slowly i lost interest, i didn't even complete the book. It goes all boring and downhill from there. It's not a guide to make you rich instantly, neither it has any ideas you can use. But it does focuses on a lot of factor we don't think much about in real lives, so that's a plus point. However, I've read various self help books, this one was was unable to keep me engaged."
179,Sachin,Decent but..,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Decent book but I found it a bit on preaching side. Too many things to consider and take care, so by the middle of book I am losing interest as I can't remember hundreds of things author is talking about. Every page has a new piece of advice."

211,Bleachin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's ok, if you have read any decent modern ""self help"" book, anything that focus on self confidence and focus,you will not gain much by reading this book. Lots of repetition and waffle, all of which is very distracting. Two sections towards the end are very useful,both focusing on negative aspects and are missing from these more modern books I talk about. The self analysis quiz and the alibis. Both sections are perfect for helping you move forward,make decisions and check changes in attitude and thinking."
212,Zed B,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's pretty much difficult for me to write the reviews of all-time best-selling books, classics. While reading the book, I didn't feel like checking out if he wrote the truth or not because what matters is the power of conviction, power of thinking, and that is what the author wants from his readers.Think and Grow Rich is a weird book I ended up liking, just not for the reasons intended by the author. The language of Hill's book is very much like the polite business writing Carnigie and it is endearing and friendly enough that I was willing to fight it through to the end. The first part of his book seems perfectly rational. The rest is just strange enough to get a kick out of.Some of the principles, values added in this book are astonishing. I don't know how much they will help one in becoming rich, and wealthier. But then there is no loss in trying these principles, activities. There is no problem in thinking that you are rich and you want to become richer, that you're wealthy and you want to become wealthier, that you're smart and you want to become smarter.Napolean Hill, again and again, tells you to focus on thinking, thinking positive, thinking big and that is how this book lures the readers to do the actions that the author wanted to.The crux of the book is that successful people think differently than the rest of us, and if we want to be successful, we need to learn to think like them. Fair enough. Hill, having spent a career studying successful people, then prescribes steps to learn to think like the successful. Develop desire, faith, and work at obtaining a specific knowledge. Get together with like-minded individuals and discuss your dealings with them in what he calls a Maser Mind Group. It all sounded pretty straight forward. It sounds like a good plan. Then he gets into how to develop faith.There are a couple of more dubious but harmless ideas in this book.  Hats, and men's fear of judgement, makes many men bald. Men are afraid of criticism, so they go along with the trend to wear hats. Many of these hats are too tight. They cut off circulation to the scalp thereby causing baldness. I am bald but I don’t think I ever wore hat!"
213,R. Daffern,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I hadnt realised this was the original 1930s? book.old fashioned hard reading, though i am sure the points made were valid and interesting, i put it down after a few chapters and havent picked it up since."

216,Sarah,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Found this book hard to relate to as the references are so old. Surely we moved on a bit and can find something a bit more relevant.
217,miss jennifer wilson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  really struggled with this book - extremely sexist and dated. when you get past the sexism there are some good ideas.
218,M. Ballon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Long read... and still very sexist, as it only talks as though only men can be successful!"
219,nuala ni dubhair,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too boring to read whole thing, nothing new"
220,muffin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  i think this was a brilliant book for when it was written. But what it professes you will have already heard from your grandma/granddad or the wise uncle! It's message can be summarized in one sentence which is kind of repeated over and over in the book. I gave up half way through.
221,JULIE GILLY,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Great book but a little disappointed with the quality.The information contained in the book is great for entrepreneurs striving for success and gives an insight into the experiences of others who have made it.
222,Aron,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good book! However I don't get the value in him ranting about how great america is for 25mins... There is some good value points but I would certainly rate the four hour work week higher than this.
223,Laheebkasim,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is an amazing book but the style of writing is so complicating for me and I found my self lose interest in finishing it because of this.I was looking for simple approach to discuss case studies that implemented those theories but I didn't find that unfortunately.
224,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A bit long winded for a thicko like me
225,Shane,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I found it hard to connect to this book. The subject is very interesting and I took a lot from it, but skimmed 50% of it because I was struggling to stay focused. Not for everyone, but many will love it."
226,@the_ad_ventures,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have been thinking for ages but haven't grown Rich yet.Is there a second book called ""Do?"""
227,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I struggled with this at times and obviously it's dated but the takeaway seems to be: turn up to work, sober, presentable and willing and success will be yours. Probably correct"
228,Shira,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A good way to analyse your current situation and how to improve yourselfIgnore some descriptions that does not relate to today's modern timesTake what you need from it and live:-)
229,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I found it very difficult to read in this format.  Love the content though
230,Heather Angell,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  it's fine but written a long time ago and although the messages are relevant now it wasn't as engaging as I'd hoped
231,Cosmin Lapovita,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The ideea is wright and i agree that Mindset is very important but it didn't made me move, i loved another book similar much more i talk about ""Mindset"" book."
232,Kavino,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Didn't realise it was paperback and a4 size. Can't read it in commute, it's big. Maybe it says in description.. (then it'll be my own fault for not reading haha)."
233,Nacou,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing PlatformCareful of the format that you buy. I mistakenly bought one that is in letter size paper printed on two columns. Not the paperback format I was expecting. Seems like the book was printed just for my order.
234,Laurence Bolton,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I am still poor!
235,Iain Richards,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Some really ueful advice around focus and mindset, although the language and format is a little dated making it quite formal and laborious to read at times"

253,carol ann morgan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  ok
254,Javier Monjas,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pensé que la revisión que se había hecho de este clásico, como en otras obras - ej. The Intelligente Investor - mantendría claramente diferenciada la versión original de los comentarios de la versión revisada. Al principio parece que es así, ya que se añaden ejemplos de grandes empresarios en párrafos claramente separados. Sin embargo la sorpresa viene después, cuando descubres entrelazado con el texto que pensabas original, referencias a internet o a los teléfonos móviles que lógicamente, en el año de salir a la luz esta obra - 1.937 - no podían vislumbrarse.Se trata de un tremendo pastiche en donde no sabes si las páginas y páginas abordando un mismo concepto, responde al añadido de 2.004 o a la obra original de 1.937. Si lo tuviera que comprar de nuevo, apostaría claramente por la versión original."
255,carlo occhiena,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Il libro è probabilmente uno dei capisaldi della letteratura ""motivazionale"", si intuiscono nettamente in esso le basi che sono state poi riprese dai suoi successori fino all'epoca moderna sulle miriadi di ebook e siti di ""esperti"" (o presunti tali).La stesura del testo è piuttosto pesante, con ricchi passaggi in MAIUSCOLO, la sensazione è di avere davanti un iracondo professore che ti inciti a studiare la lezione. Alcuni capitoli sono decisamente datati, il libro va pensato per un'audience prettamente w.a.s.p.Dalla sua però va detto che viene venduto ad un prezzo ridicolo, e comunque molti principi sono validi tutt'ora e ben espressi. Inoltre, per chi ama il genere, è davvero una lettura che viene citata spessissimo in altre opere e permette di capire con maggiore profondità anche le opere più moderne. Interessante notare come il ""grow rich"" del titolo sia in senso letterale (""fai un pacco di soldi"") mentre nelle stesure moderne il focus si sposta maggiormente sulla ""ricchezza spirituale"". I tempi cambiano :)In definitiva vale la pena averlo in libreria anche solo per una sfogliata veloce."
256,vale,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It was an easy read but I didn't learn anything new from it.Most of the numerous rules of how to manage money are just common sense. There are some that do not apply to people living outside of the USA and some that I already read in other books. I honestly don't remember any rule that I never heard before or that it would trigger that AHA moment. Most of the rules are how to save the money which is something I have been taught from early days from my parents. But I guess for someone who did not have that, he might actually benefit from the book."
257,Mar,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Quick delivery. I haven’t read it yet but I know it’s a good read. I am though, disappointed of the size of this paperback book. Too big!!! I should have looked at the book dimensions, m’y fault . I just assumed that it was your typical normal size paperback book, but it’s not. Way too big and not convenient."
258,Ernesto Sanchez,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book is good but I found boring sometimes! The book is all about that you can do all things when you start to believe in yourself
259,SJRB,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Liked this book because it help me analyze my way of thinking for this time with all that is happening in the world economy, and being written from someone who lived the great depression you just understand the history alwas repeats itself."
260,AP,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  There has been a lot of changes since the book was released. It focuses a lot on material things as end goal but you indeed learn alot about the mindset. Make sure you focus on the mindset and being happy. Good book overall.
261,Sebastian bomford,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I like the idea of the book it has a lot of good theory it has great ideas as into how to improve your life improve your self development and habits but I don't like some of the examples the book gives as they are examples from a really long time ago I found it boring in some ways.
262,Shivali,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book is really helpful when getting into the money-making mindset. However the format of this book is like a school textbook. It's large and not as compact as a normal reading book. The size of the letters is normal though.
263,Mark,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book was written some 80 years ago and it shows. The underlying message how ever (I think it's 12 characteristics of the wealthy) is spot on. But at times very dull and patronising (at one point I recall the author explaining the benefits of wearing a smart suit to a meeting with a potential employer). I did not finish this book, at about a third of the way through I bought the audio book then gave up on that another third in! this is because the messages are good but the content/delivery is not. I would revisit this if someone would rewrite it for the modern market."
264,D. Seymour,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book starts with some useful pointers about working out what you want, forming a plan, believing in yourself and going for it.  For that it's worthwhile.  Then it gets into 'sex transmutation,' telepathy, clairvoyance, and the author's practice of having a 'council' of imaginary friends who sometimes show up early, sometimes late, to have discussions with him."
265,RP,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Un libro cardine del self help, del network marketing e del business in generale. Lo trovo moooolto datato. Verso metá é diventato di una noia incredibile"

272,conrad,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would say it was well written. Some good stuff in it, but for me it rehashed concepts and ideas I already knew"
273,Pejo Guberac,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  There is good information. But also some useless.
274,consuelo olariaga,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The reading is just OK.  A bit repetitive sometimes. In my opinion, this is just another self-help book about the topic of making money."
275,bryce,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book is good but in some places its cut and dry i reccomend starting at chapter 5
276,Salhi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  C'est la base de la pensée entrepreneuriale, Napoleon Hill à évoqué la méthode à suivre pour se construire et se forger un esprit d'entrepreneur et apprendre à ne jamais baisser les bras, le livre est bon mais commence à se faire un peu vieux et dépassé."
277,Robin Shawkat,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Napoleon Hill describes many good ideas and methods to be more effective, but compared to other Books (e.g. ""The slight edge"" by Jeff Olson"") his style of writing is completely boring, which makes the book hard to read."
278,Jonathan Bouvrette,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  CONSIt is not very well done.The seller printed the text so near the border of the book that is not readable in a nice way..(subjective)Its more a booklet sizePROSPrice goodNice coverShipping is fast to QuebecThe content stay the same as its free off the internet.

281,Devere Wolfe,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I typically purchased this one in a hope to be inspired to turn into the next Warren Buffet. Obviously I am not a Warren Buffet nor likely to be in my life time.The book is concise and covers the ground rules of becoming more market savvy, I suppose.I would never decry such a book however, this one I  have to say is a work in progress. Will it turn you into a rich person? Who knows."
282,Mohamad Eid Yasin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bom livro, mas com vários conceitos de auto ajuda que já li em outros momentos. Muito parecido com ""O segredo"", na minha opinião."
283,Reader,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book is too short and the ideas explained are only a few.
284,joan-angel amills alpuente,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Me ha gustado, aunque es más bien personal...no objetivo...pero tiene ideas interesantes"
285,RedDragon55,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I know that many people rave about this book.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't all bad but it basically says that if you want to make it you have to get off your butt and work to get there.  Much of what is here reads like a propaganda exercise and appears to have been written to spur post war/depression Americans into action.  It is dated, especially comments like men go bald because they wear tight hats! (seriously).  Now I know where I went wrong...  hold on though, I've never owned a hat?"
286,JPmiami,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Il libro non ha certo bisogno di presentazione, purtroppo il link contenuto, utile per il download dell'audio libro, non è disponibile. Sarebbe commercialmente corretto se la casa editrice o Amazon mi fornissero un link alternativo, visto che ho pagato anche anche per l'audio libro.."
287,Sjaak Liebregts,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  A standard story about tangible richness. Well written, quite easy reading but nothing new if you follow economic developments in the world environment."
288,David Yeung,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Will read it again.
289,jb,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  it has an interesting philosophy.  It was not quite what I suspected and therefore will listen to it once more if i have time.
290,Karen,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Plain and boring
291,Dave,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  boring
292,Sah DB.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's an interesting book but Hill stays too mysterious about many things. It could be written more concise too. Remember, Hill died in poverty so..."
293,Ponono,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Je l’ai utilisé pour faire une lecture de groupe, une sorte d’analyse de ses messages.Je bien aime le fait que puise l’avoir toujours disponible sur mes appareils.Ce que je n’ai pas aimé du tout est le format des lettres en noire avec un fond bleu. C’est terrible pour le lire."
294,eden,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  not as amazing as people say but still good advice
295,M.S.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very condensed text (they fitted two pages into one). Makes it hard to read, but tiny book."

298,Guest Account,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  ok
299,Fred Linz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  A little stylized & time structured, but the message is still valid, if you want to devote your life to the pursuit of riches"
300,SarahB,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There are very sound financial principles in this book and I found the anecdotal evidence presented about famous businessmen and politicians added an interesting snapshot of American history; however, I struggled initially with the language, and found the text very repetitive.The book could easily have been a lot shorter and more concise while retaining the quality of the argument and soundness of the advice.Overall, it contains sound advice about persistence and basic financial planning that is useful for anyone considering starting out in business.  Be prepared for an element of repetition, though."
301,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I Didn't realize that even the reading of this book was so old. Still has good information.
302,driss,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Le livre que j'ai reçu n'était pas en bon état : il était couvert de colle d'un côté avec des morceaux de cartons collés. J'ai passé 1 heure à l'enlever mituculeusement afin de ne pas abîmer le livre.
303,THANK YOU!,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Great message but extremely short when you compare to other audio cds.Only 2 cds long but still some important points of view put across.
304,Kiran,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good.
305,silent_siren,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This isn't a full comment on the book as I did not finish it so it's more of a warning that if you can't divorce the time this book was written in from the content then you'll find it really hard going. The first 50 pages alone contain some really racist and ableist stuff and unfortunately the authors teaching style is to repeat stories to drill them home so even if you cringe and skip an offending paragraph you're going to keep running into it. If you can get past that you might find more value in the book than I did. Again, not judging the book as it's a product of its time, but if you can't look past that then you're better off not making the purchase."
306,S. Gordon,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pretty dated (warning - some pretty un-PC sections which would be unacceptable today in terms of diversity and equality), but still has some useful things to say to business people.  I did a more detailed review here: [...]"
307,FORTUNE,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A bit out dated
308,Danroy Toast,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I had been lead to believe that this book was the best thing since sliced bread, but it really was a bit disapointing.Although fairly inspiring, every chapter has a large section telling you what the book is about. I bought the book, I didn't then need to find out what it was about.This could be condensed to a much better and shorter book, I got this for 99p and I think thats about right as it really isn't worth much mroe than many of the free books in the genre.Worth a read and mildly inspiring, but repetitive, very very repetitive to the extent of boredom at times!1) work hard and don't give up2) work with good people3) write down and repeat to yourself your goals every day.Thats about the content of the book and no amount of attempts by the author to try and make the 'secret' sound intriguing it really isn't, this books whole premise is that if you just work hard and keep going you won't fail."
309,R A OWENS,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  good book
310,Catalin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Could have the power to be motivational for some people.
311,LuckyMe!,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A long read.
312,KEIKO,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This book may be a bible with either good titles or summaries in every chapter.
313,Francois,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Be careful, it looks like comments for every version of the book are put together.I first got the ""Think and Grow Rich"" paperback version for $7.94. Worst version, the printing is awful and extremely hard to read. It's like it's been copy pasted without even checking if the format had been messed up (which it had).I then bought the ""Think and Grow Rich - Original Edition"" paperback for version for $5.99. It has a much better formatting. Very thin book though.About the book, I couldn't get myself to finish it. Has some good advice but a lot of it feels outdated."
314,Uriel 888,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have read this book 2 or 3 times over the years and its never worked for me honestly. If the book really works, tell me why is only 3% of the population wealthy and in control of all the money? They say we already have the money, but I don't see it. Its not in my hands or bank account and it doesn't explain that part of course lol. I spend years doing affirmations daily and filling my subconscious mind with wealthy thoughts. Guess what? I am still poor folks. Go buy some food instead of wasting your time and energy on this book. I was hopeful and positive. I really tried, but it didn't work for me. Same old reality."
315,Merry,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this book expecting some light, hippie, self-help stuff about the power of motivation or creativity or whatever. The problem is, the author takes those ideas WAY TOO SERIOUSLY and has written a whole scientific dissertation on them.At 300 pages and some pretty complex sentences, mixed in with ample use of the words ""ether"" and ""vibration,"" this is not light reading. It is a religious text. I would take the author much more seriously if he took himself a little bit more lightly.On the bright side, this seems to be the book that inspired many more, much better-written books along the same general lines."
316,AmazonCustomer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I think if you need a psychological crutch to do what you already know you need to do, then this is a good book for you.  If you are already in control of your thoughts and dwell in concrete reality - knowing that to get what you want in this life you need to work hard, preserver and never give up, then this book will add nothing to what you already inherently know and do.  Not worth my time...."
317,Joseph Joe,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Just something to read. Maybe some people will get more out of the book than others. It depends on where your mind state is at during the time when you read it. It is repetitive, yet purposefully. One could probably read 1/4 to 1/2 of the book and get all of it’s worth out of it... Just to touch on something from the book: there is a brief story of the beginning of “Coca Cola”. That story makes it seem as if “Coca Cola” became successful from a secret ingredient. That ingredient being an “idea” as stated in the book. This is false because the actual ingredient that was secretive was cocaine... But do not buy this book purely for this reason. It was just something that stuck out to me."
318,Pete Nikolai,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good reminder of the need to be proactive and intentional but could have been said in far fewer words. Author also falls into the camp of those who think everyone can get rich. Failure to acknowledge and compensate for the weaknesses of many people leads to perspectives and policies that contribute to suffering.
319,Quiquillo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  When I saw the word ""unedited"" I thought the book would be more similar to the manuscript, where people who had access to the manuscript could see that Napoleon Hills used the concept of Law of Attraction and the concept of vibration to explain why things work the way they do; in other words the elusive ""Secret"" that he writes about all over his book and never to be seing. No wonder it can't be found it was redacted by the publishers. It is a great book worth reading it but the Secret is to be found elsewhere."
320,Old Texan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I seem to have two of these, this and the special edition, I only ordered one, but there is no way to delete/return these, but for .49 cents, it doesn't matter. I have read this book, but wanted to refresh my memory of it.One has to remember that it is popular with the California left coast mystical, incense burning crowd.  Forty nine cents is about all it is worth.Just think yourself to whatever you desire in life."
321,martha white,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it, so thought I'd re-read it after I lost my copy. The book is an easy read, but it is just too dated now to be a compelling read."
322,icheva,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I picked up this book because it was an option on a list of required reading for a class I took. It has some interesting concepts about having the right mind set for finding success in life, some of them very good, but the book was written long ago and some of the examples are very outdated. Also, not that I feel it is a negative in the book but more of an amusing observation. you can see a hint of racial prejudice in the writing. It isn't intentional, but those were different times and it is apparent in some of the examples. Overall, I didn't care much for the book although I did enjoy some of the psychology behind the concepts even though the author was forcing a sense of mystery in the subject. But, if I were to purchase it again, I would grab it from Amazon, no problems there at all."
323,James,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  While the book certainly put forth some great ideas and advice, it was filled with many arbitrary anecdotes. Some of the basic principles professed by the author are certainly thought provoking and likely helpful if put into practice. Much of the book was just babbling.I will employ some of the ideas from the book, but overall it was disappointing. I would recommend this book being that it is thought provoking at times and has some value with certain principles discussed, but I would warn future readers that they may find themselves rolling their eyes at times drudging through the anecdotes."
324,David Shifrin,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  For $0.99 I can't really complain. But I will, just a little. I purchased this particular edition of Think and Grow Rich in hopes that whatever the contributions of Arthur Pell were, they would be valuable. Sadly, this was not the case. The book is a landmark and a must-read, and Dr. Pell's italicized additions unfortunately distracted from Hill's original brilliance. The intent of adding modern examples to Hill's roster of early 20th century moguls was laudable. However, those sections were written in a way that didn't fit with the original, and they rarely added much to the discussion. (The bit on Mary Kay Ash was something of an exception to this criticism.) These modern names were picked to replace more obscure individuals from the 30's, the preface states, while the really big players like Edison, Ford, and Carnegie remained intact. Overall, I just didn't feel like the changes were done well or smoothly.I haven't read the original, and I can understand why some of the names might not register for a reader in 2015, but I'd probably recommend sticking with the version that includes only Napoleon Hill on the cover."
325,AbeK,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Napolean Hill is great. This abridged and ""modern"" update is not. They took any modern success and tried to ""push"" it in to every chapter whether it made sense or not. Additionally they cut the edge of the pages in a weird way to give it an ""old"" feel which makes for difficulity in turning the pages. If you can get the original untouched version."
326,LT,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book was recommended to me by someone who is financially successful. I have had a chance to put the ideas into practice yet, so I can't comment on the ideas presented. However, I do have two general comments.I don't know what the original looked like, but this version has a LOT of typos which give the appearance that this version was a self-published book, done by someone with another version by their side while they typed it word-for-word into their own computer.Another thing that bothered me is that the author vascillates from calling Christ ""The Master"" and equating him with ""other great leaders"" who used the power of the sixth sense in their life's work. There are others, as well. As a Christian, that bothered me a great deal. I'm not saying you shouldn't purchase the book for that reason, just that you should be prepared for it."
327,oleksandr.kucherenko,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  All things in a book can be replaced by 20-pages article. Too many history fallbacks, when just needed a one example. Another bad habbit of author is to delay the core of the topic discussion by ""in next paragraph i will finally said what its all about"" and 5 paragraphs later he repeat the same thing...Ok. Good points:Section of fears - really good!Section of self analysis by questioning - great, but can be shorter. Will be good to see the real example of transformation.Why i set low rate?! 50% of the book is a waist of time, other 50% can be shrinked to 20 pages."
328,Nelson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book really gets hyped up alot, but I'm not so sure. I would rather recommend How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. Thank and Grow Rich however, just didn't do it for me. It was long and drawn out and didn't offer much practical advice. I believe if I hadn't read How to Win Friends and Influence people I would have enjoyed Think and Grow Rich More. It's a dull ready honestly."
329,Jorge,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This whole book is just a build-up to one simple piece of advice. It has entertaining stories but at the same time some of them feel made-up. Just look up the Sparknotes or some spoilers for this book, find out what the ""secret"" is, and move on."
330,Cats for Peace,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is review of the physical book format, not the content.  The book is quite thin and has very small print, which I wasn’t expecting.  Perhaps that’s what the original was like.  But unfortunately for me, I’m going to have to use my readers to read it."
331,Cory,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Overall I liked the book. Some great examples of what helped make successful people successful and focuses on money consciousness. Definitely gets abstract near the end. The other thing that I didn't care for as much is that in much of the 1st quarter of the book the author repeats over an over about ""the things in this book will..."" and ""if you read this book...""  I'm obviously already reading the book so I don't need to constant plugs for it. I will probably reread this book so like I said, overall pretty good."
332,Jennifer L. Cook,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I thought this book came with Whispersync, it did not.  It did come with narration but you have to download each Chapter as an individual download.  Mine kept skipping back to the beginning.  Got frustrated and stop trying to make the narration work.  I don't have a lot of time to read the actual book so after having it all this time I am just on chapter 5, where on the books with narration or audible, I have finished at least 5 books in that time.  Disappointed to say the least."
333,Michael Wilson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's intentionally misleading that the title listed is ""Earl Nightingale Reads Think and Grow Rich"".This audio program (only about an hour) is Earl Nightingale reading a synopsis that he'd written of the book.It's fine, enlightening, well presented and interesting.But it is NOT the audio book version of Think and Grow Rich."
334,Farnoosh Brock,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I can't count how many times I have heard of this book mentioned among entrepreneurs and successful people in general, a lot of them my own friends and role models, but alas, I did not care for Think and Grow Rich. I gave this book more than its fair shake and here's my reaction.It starts out really strong, and delivers home a great, great message - about creating your own destiny with intense desire and singular focus about what you want and making the ultimate decision that you will make it happen, come hell or high water.OK, I am with you so far, Mr. Hill, and I am willing to come along.But then the book goes into story after story, and every time the author makes a point, he has to go into CAPITAL LETTER mode to shout it at me. WHY? I am not deaf - I can hear you even if you say it without all that intensity. Once or twice, I get it but the writing voice just becomes more annoying and almost belligerent to the point that I just couldn't read it. In fact, for a while, I was reading it and staying detached, just to see what else I could gather without getting emotionally connected with the author ... And listen, there are some great points in this book IF you can stand the writer's voice, the repetition of the same bloody points over and over, and the occasional degrading way he talks to you about how you WILL FAIL if you do such and such ....Just couldn't finish the book. I read about 30% and I have a strong feeling the remaining 70% might have covered pretty much the same thing.Maybe I am not in a place in my life to appreciate this book but I thought I am in the perfect place - I have changed the course of my career and my life 360 degrees, I LIVE and breathe the principles that the author talks about and I am starving for more but alas, I could simply not finish this book for the life of me. What I read, I will use and I will continue to appreciate the concepts. Hope this helps you decide what you might do about the book."
335,tommylinsley,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great book, but Amazon doesn't make the included audio files readily available. Amazon owns Audible, so one might expect that the audio files for this book would be delivered in Audible, like other audiobooks. Amazon gets a big Fail on this one. The only way I see to get the audio files is to go to the very end of the ebook and Manually download the files. I love the ebook version, but Amazon fails miserably in the delivery of the included audiobook portion. Very, very disappointed with Amazon!!!"
336,Tim kelly,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I wasnt expected it to be a giant paperback. Was kind of expecting a book with normal dimensions instead of abnormally large pages to the point it should just be hard cover. Yeah i sound pompus but i wouldve bought the ebook version if I knew this was too big to fit my bag.......
337,Melissa,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you want the tl:dr version of Think and Grow Rich, this might be for you. It has quick versions of all the chapters, so if you just want a quick skim through this is your audiobook. Also, its interesting to hear Earl Nightingale read it."
338,Nicole Herman,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  A friend of mine recommended this book to me a while ago. I got it but have not been able to really get into it. It seems like heavy reading to me and its written in a riddle format that I find a bit frustrating. The writer keeps referring to this secret thats going to jump out at me... I have kind of given up on it for now. will revisit at some stage and re post with update.
339,Brian Rose,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Even the format is literally, exactly the same, where the writer avoids saying, but constantly hints at, the BIG SECRET, for nearly half the book.Basically, whatever you focus on in life you tend to accomplish. If your mind is occupied by bills, and rote, menial tasks, then that's all you'll experience in life. If you focus on constantly growing and challenging yourself, then that's what you'll experience in life. Daniel Kahneman refers to this as ""What You Know Is All There Is"". Your emotional state and perceived quality of life is a reflection of what you know. There could be a rabid raccoon sitting behind you right now, but if you don't know it then it doesn't effect you. Put your mental energy into being grateful and allows striving to raise your standards every day.I just saved you $X because that about covers it."
340,Russ,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  You might enjoy the read. The author sites those underlying traits that are common to most highly successful, self-made people. It's no surprise to find that these icons of industry thrived on recognizing opportunities, setting goals and strategies, and following through with hard work."
341,Gustavo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Still reading it.
342,Michal,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book has many positive points but sometimes goes off the deepend.Evidently according to this book.  Men go bald because they wear hats.  Women don't go bald because their hats fit more loosely.  A man without ambition is worthless.There are things here that could be written better.  Some of it can be downright discouraging instead of trying to help you.  Other parts are superstitious and if I had not heard them explained better earlier I would have found this book very difficult to digest.I preferred Awaken the Giant within, mastery and psycho-cybernetics.  They have a more modern positive approach.  An approach that does not rely on religion and superstition."
343,Cyntana,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I must not be thinking hard enough, so far these tips haven't worked for me."
344,Kyra Siebert,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Purchased this for a sales team meeting. I wasn't very impressed with the outdated  preaching and will be sending my copy to the local Goodwill.
345,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Can’t find it to read it
346,Chiké,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This particular copy of the book is incomplete. Total page count is 184 however this copy ends at 183. I have the audible compliment that goes to the end. Hoping it's fixed. Apart from this. This book is a life changer.
347,Reinhard,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  There are some great chapters with awesome content in this book. There are also some kooky chapters. I’m not a fan of how the book was written, but I do think it’s a must read."
348,Irma,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Hard to play...need media player...but all is good after that...
349,Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's ok. I don't comprehend most of it
350,Mumtaz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Recieved it on time but a little ripped from sides
351,Gregory C. Brown,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Same old, same old... a lot of common sense philosophy that is excellent... A good read to kick start yourself again. But only practice makes perfect!"
352,Tom,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Boring
353,Anonymous1,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book reminds me of ""The Secret"". Napoleon Hill contests that through the application of positive thinking, planning, and visualization one will be able to attain all of the financial goals he or she sets. While staying focused on your goals is important, it takes more than just believing that you will be a millionaire to become one."
354,bdyro,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Have heard the principles from others in one form or another over the years; it is possible those ""others"" got their insight from Mr. Hill too. It is worth revisiting the concepts to remind and revitalize and redirect focus."
355,jnguyen,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  If anyone is interested in personal development, Napoleon Hill is a name that you hear about all the time. When I first got this book, I expected a lot of great things, but after reading it, I was fairly disappointed. This book is very repetitive. Almost every point that this book makes leads down to the same thing, have a burning desire. This book is basically a law of attraction book about business. I do agree with the points that they make about how your mind has to arrive at the destination before you physically do and that thoughts carry a lot of power if mixed in with faith, however, if you are already into personal development for a while now then this book won't really offer anything new."
356,Gerry Parker,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This was advertised at UNABRIDGED.  I thought I was ordering the reading of Think and Grow Rich UNABRIDGED.  THe advertising is misleading.  But I will keep the CD.
357,Judy H. Luck,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  How can you think and grow rich.  Really, if it were that simple, don't you think everyone in this world would be rich.  I think I will try and easier way.  What that is will take a little research."
358,Robert J. Steckert,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I read this book many years ago. This is an upgrade to make it more relevant. I am for positive thinking, but I believe the author goes a little too far."
359,Rmay702,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good material. Seems to be dating itself quite a bit with references to people, places, and things that were important 100 years ago.....  The principles are still important today, but we certainly need to update it to present times and needs....."
360,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This book contains some useful advice to strengthen our character. It is mainly motivational and seems outdated for younger readers.
361,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  :)
362,D. Vera,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Somehow the OCR didn't properly translate a whole bunch of words.  Very distracting for an important book.For the price, it's a no brainer but expect to guess at what some of the sentences mean and to run into incomplete sentences."
363,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I decided to read this book primarily as it was referenced in several others books I've read. Therefore, curiosity got the better of me and I finally took the plunge. I am glad I decided to take some time to ingest the teachings of Napoleon Hill in this book. Although some of the teachings seem a tad outdated or at times a bit of a stretch to me, the majority of the lessons are still just as applicable today as they were when the book was originally published. I'd have to say it's worth the time to take a step back and read an oldie but a goodie."
364,KDZman,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Intereasting
365,Louis Cristaline,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  A very basic book including a lot of interesting philosophical ideas on the mindset of successful people. Unfortunately it contains very little ""how to"" or the techniques proposed are difficult to put into practice by a novice in psychology.So good book but needs some updates."
366,SpencerB,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The information in the book is great. Just as you would expect. However, don't buy this book because it is cheap. Spend your money on a higher quality book from a better publisher. Every page has gramatical errors. It seems like someone copied this book from a book of notes with editing marks and all included. Everywhere throughout the book the word ""in"" is spelled ""m."" There are random numbers in the middle of sentences. Poor value book. I will be buyinga hardcopy from a good publisher before putting it in my bookshelf or lending to anyone."
367,Bia,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  it's good
368,Jeff Mosleh,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Great book. It's too long for the message that it's trying to portray. It probably could have been doing in less then a 100 pages but I still recommend it.
369,Michael S,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Think and grow rich.  Or do and grow rich.
370,BB,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  good advice but repetitive.
371,Jeryl,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It was okay.
372,Angelica keene,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book looked a little torn up the pages was hanging but it was all there and clean and I love to read
373,Domino Brown,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This was suggested by a friend. Didn't hold my interest long.
374,kimo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I would say at a minimum the book is thought provoking.  Though I had known about this book for many years, I never chose to read it mainly because the title (Think and Grow Rich) put me off...sort of sounded a bit too cultish I suppose. What I found most interesting was the views the author and others held about the future from the perspective of existing in the midst of the great depression when all seemed hopeless and lost.  Even though much of the language used in the book is somewhat dated, his description of the mechanics of the mind was what was most thought provoking to me...and which most of which I accept.  Was recommended I read this book as part of an forex trading strategy course I am presently taking."
375,New Jersey Mom,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The parts of the book that I could actually piece together seemed very interesting; however, the CD which I received and tried to play was all jumbled (jumped from Track 3 to 7 to 1 to 2...etc). I could not piece it together, and therefore, it never flowed right. Buy the book, not the audio CD."
376,Chad,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I go with 3 of 5 stars because I was expecting to get the full audio book but instead what I received was a single cd that was a blurb of each chapter. The content was very good and worth the purchase I was hoping for the entire book. Oops on me but oops on them too for not stating that it's only 45 minutes about the book.
377,Military mom shopper,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book has good advice but I didn't finish it because it basically suggests you need a good idea to become rich which is no big secret if you ask me. Another thing is that is advises basically becoming obsessed with being rich in order to become rich. I guess those might both be true statements but truthfully who wants to be obsessed with becoming rich? I want to be rich God's way which means I'll have the peace to enjoy it. I'll finish reading this book eventually but I suppose I was afraid of becoming a greedy, obsessed person if I take his advice."
378,M. J. Krauth,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book was OK.  I was recommended to it by a colleague.  It was written back in the 30's (it refers to the ""rock stars"" of the corporate world as Henry Ford and Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison!).  Good, time-tested ideas.  Especially on persistence.  However, alot of it was quite boring and outdated.  I felt as if I was reading it just to get through it and not truly enjoying it and learning from it.  As previously mentioned, the chapter on persistence was the one exception.  Great advice there.  Overall.....not bad, but not great."
379,KRo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book is 5-star, hands down. However, the speaker on the audiobook can't even pronounce words like ""finite"" or ""Socrates."" ....😑 It's still doable in the car."
380,J. Engle,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book *is* dated, but it's worth reading. I gleaned some valuable ideas from this book: thoughts on being positive, and the fact that one's state of mind determines your actions and therefore the direction of your life.My only issue with this book is the manner in which it was printed. There were some really bad printing errors in my copy, some that made potentially important words simply unintelligible. I'd suggest looking for a different publisher."
381,Sam,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It’s got some good foundational principles but did play on the minds of the needy. A very interesting read when you want to be reminded of the past.
382,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I enjoyed this read and think many of the principles will be instrumental to helping the reader change their lives. However there's a lot of dated mystical thinking around the mind that readers should take with a grain of salt.
383,mimi,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  It was an ok read, I received some good insights.  Easy read and entertaining.  I liked it better then ""Rich Dad Poor Dad""."
384,Arizona Wayne,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Not complete. This was only part of the book. Very disappointed. The part covered was good.
385,Sebueng,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'd heard a lot about the book and how it has changed people's lives. I found it adequate, and somewhat inspirational, but I prefer the 'power of positive thinking' in many ways, for inspirational books."
386,Jersey Girl,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Nice new book
387,Kanicia Hardwick,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  It's an okay read
388,Shayna,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  The Book is great but this digital version is not good at all. Lots of errors, weird formatting, etc. I would recommend the book, but not this version."
389,16Tons,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perhaps relevant, but seems coached in very dated language. Should have expected the writing style since it was written many years ago."
390,j henderson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I wish I would have purchased a more contemporary version of this book. The book does not have the paragraph structure or flow that a modern edited book would have. I am not a book snob, by any means, but the lack of structure is distracting. Also, some of the content is a little hokey - for example: your mind creates vibrations from your thoughts which are picked up by the universe and become reality and an entire section on mental telepathy. I am sure that in 1937, these concepts were more believable, but in 2015 they are a little hard to swallow."
391,J. Perkins,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I enjoy reading this book from time to time, and thought it would be nice to have on my kindle to browse once in a while. But this version is so riddled with typos that it is very difficult to read at all. I'm highlighting them as I go, and will submit them to Amazon when I'm done…hopefully it will improve over time."
392,Brian Batts,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I've heard a lot of motivational, educational, and financial audiobooks in my day, and while this one is a classic, I was disenchanted by the readers style of delivery. The readers monotone energy becomes tiring after an hour of listening. And he pronounces 'Socrates' (the philosopher)...like the guy on Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. You know, 'SocrATES'.The material seems to be centered around the want for money, money, money without much focus on WHY you want the money for yourself....like a blind faith that acquiring money is the end all be all."
393,Adrian Lemcke,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Expected something else.
394,Raimundo H.,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  some good points, some not so good."
395,Carol Poole,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  The book is not what I thought it wad going to be.  It is a good book but goes into alot of talk of other people.
396,Nancy Kosciolek,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Book was mentioned by a business writer columnist in the Minneapolis Star & Tribune.  I accidentally purchased instead of trying a sample.  But since it was so cheap I decided to keep it.  It starts our okay then it turns weird -- almost manifest destiny like.
397,S. Williams,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Good information but found Wallace Wattles book ""The Science of Getting Rich "" a better read on the same subject!"
398,Eric Grimmett,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Good knowledge but definitely needs updated information.
399,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  working on it!
400,Mr. Dumpling,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  All about positive thinking, not about knowledge and how to use it."
401,Sandra Vish,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Did not quite understand chapter on transmutation utilizing sexual desire as motivation.  How does this equate to success and wealth?
402,Pam,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Was a good book
403,Jeffrey Gibson,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  This is not original version
404,Mark,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Be warned. If you are spelling/grammar freak, don't buy this book."
405,Book lover,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I put a three star review to be fair since I received another book instead. The book has the same cover featured on this site (the person on top of a mountain - red cover) however the Christmas Carol story (Scrooge and all) was the text.I am assuming this is a printing mistake, but since I paid around $2 for this book I won't be returning it.I suggest that you order the other versions of this book and pay the few extra bucks.Peace."
406,AC,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Great information, but not the most entertaining :-)"
407,Th3 Krack3n,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Pretty good. Written poorly or bad possibly edition not proofed
408,Lauren Fairfield,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Interesting. Still working my way through it
409,Kindle Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Read this one a thousand times. I will always recommend this book.
410,Brett W. Iwanowicz,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  As I am reading this book, I am starting to see a pattern but will fully divulge once I have completed the book.  I did want to initiate a response of an uneasiness that I felt reading particular parts of the book.  We have all heard countless stories of success but often times we do not hear of the wake of disaster men leave to reach whatever their goal may be.  Obsessions cause men  at times to do whatever it takes to reach a goal, even if that means loosing his family and friends and often leading to the sensation of never being fulfilled.  I do agree with the power of thought, before reading this book I have experienced its effectiveness.  Placing all your energy and focus, creating an obsession in one area of your life is extremely unhealthy and lonely.... I mean look at Walter White!!! haha, but seriously, same scenario."
411,jbwam,,3.0 out of 5 stars,"  This ""Original Version"", ""Restored"" is not the original.  Why is it that everybody seems to think a lie is ok nowadays, especially copy writers??""Revised"" is what this is.  Revised is not what I wanted.  My time is wasted.Other reviewers, and other reviews of versions mixed in here by Amazon, either did not pick up on, or do not recognize the authority of the true original version.Power is in the true orignal because it is the universal authority.I will not go into all the details, but this ""Version"" is not the original.For starters, ""men"" has been changed to ""people"" even when it talks about sex drive and accomplishment.  This book was a study of MEN, and if that is changed, it is no longer a study at all, but a suggestion.I found the PDF of the real, true version.  I suggest you get that.There is power imparted by the authority of the original man and men's stories, and this power is damaged when the work is changed, especially when gender is changed.Is this not fraud to change this recognized work?"
412,Amazon Customer,,3.0 out of 5 stars,  I have read 5 pages since I got it

0,Chau Nihal,DON'T GO WITH THE CROWD.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm just writing what I felt.I was hyped to read the book.But after reading some few chapters,I feel like the author was trying to convey ""MONEY!MONEY!MONEY"" and the title of the book was somewhat misleading.There were some appreciable chapters to read.But the way this book was just focussed mainly on money,I didn't like it.Well its not like I hate financial books,there are some very good self help finance books like RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki which I hope you all will like.Anyways writing a book is not easy.Kudos to the author to share his ideas."
1,MOUNIKA,"So much of clumsiness , reduces the interest in reading books",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Please don't go for this if you are  new to the habit of reading  books.. I'm  writing this after reading 80 pages.. the writing  style is completely clumsy, at every lesson he says what he already said and what he is gonna say, and uses the complicated words unnecessarily.. it's  complete waste of time.. it will reduce the interest of reading books if you are a beginner.. Go for ""the power of subconscious mind"" by Joseph murphy instead  of this..."
2,Amazon Customer,Excessively hyped one ...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  First thing first ,this book was written hundred years back so definitely it focuses on the great depression of America and written accordingly to guide people of that era . The principles and methods mentioned are of little use now .It is so redundant that the author narrated the same line in different ways .No practical example given of people who used such methods and found them worthy . If there are one or two then the explanation is so vague that you can't comprehend.All in all , it is a hyped one with no practical worth . So think and think wisely before picking this one.My suggestion - Go for books written by Dale Carnegie , especially How to win friends and influence people..."
3,Saurabh Gupta,Boring,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very boring book, there is nothing new in this book. Makes you feel sleepy."
4,Akshay,Not that great. I will suggest not to buy it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Too long and topics are stressed unnecessarily. Since this book was published many years back, language is difficult to understand. Most of the topics are common sense and points which people already knowIf you have read other self improvement books, don't think this is necessary to buy."
5,Sanjay Kumar Khandelwal,Customer Dissatisfied,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not satisfied with the paper quality of this so called famous book - ""Think & Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill  While providing the books on discounted rates Amazon should also consider the Paper Quality because when a customer make any purchase. The first impression goes for - Product ordered at Amazon."
6,Bluemoon,Affirmations to make you Rich.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This book is more like affirmations to make you rich.Even though its positive it isn't really helpful.It only makes you think positively but doesn't really help you in gaining wealth technically.
7,Amazon Customer,Boring overated,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book is boring . The author firstly keeps talking about some secret which we can find anywhere on the book . The book is overrated. It was so boring. I gave two stars only because of the quality of book amazon provided.If you want a good self helf book go for""25 principles of success "" it is much better."
8,Account,Terribly edited book,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Terribly edited book. If you really want to buy this book then it'd be better if you buy the original one.Most of the scientific stuff that the author describes are either outdated or wrong. Other than that it is a pretty good self-help book.
9,Rachana,Hard Bind book - But paper quality worst,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The contents of the book is great as I expected.  But the quality of the book is very bad for the price I have paid. I am quality conscious and ordered the hard bind version thinking that the paper quality would be good. But the paper quality is worst, just like a cheap paper back edition."

63,Mandar Joshi,May be not of my type :(,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I purchased it by going through reviews but after starting reading it i realized that my choice differs from the commentators. No comments on the contents of the book as may be i don't like this kind of literature.
64,Coimbatore subramanian,OK.BUT NOT THE BEST,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Only the first two chapters are worth reading. All the remaining pages contain full of rubbish like becoming a political leader, America's economic depression, America's freedom history, capital, labor problems, running a restaurant ... this... that...All these have been added only for the purpose of extending the book to several pages.  If you buy this book on the expectation of learning some methods to train your mind and thoughts to accumulate wealth then YOU WOULD BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.  The book can not claim the title 'THE BEST' as many readers reviewed here, because  the contents deviate much from the title.  In my opinion, the books written by Joseph Murphy, Jose Silva and M.R.Kopmeyer are far better on this subject."
65,AJ 91,"It's ""Think and Grow money""",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book is more about growing rich in terms of money. When I bought this book, I thought it will be about growing urself and about soul or happiness. It's more or less like The Secret. You will get bored in the beginning as author keeps repeating same stuff over and over again.Conclusion: if you want to read a book which tells u about how to get rich, it's for u. If you are like me who wants to read more about meaning of life or finding a purpose or deeper things, it's not for you."

68,Amz Vip,I didn't get it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I didn't get it because, I didn't get the link between the title of the book and its content. I would have given much higher rating if the book had title like 'how to be successful', or something like that. I kinda felt like the title was misleading. The book talks about desire, hunger, etc, which is important for anything, and not just for making money."
69,Aditya Mehta,Not scientifically backed. Lacks depth,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I had no issue with quality of book. It was from amazing reads. I felt the content of the book was limited and mostly covered in initial 1 or 2 chapters. Rest book was just reiterating the same with not so proper experiences or science backed research.

80,Tanmay,Not worth the pages,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have must respect for author. Ok making it two from one.But the book is not very coherent. Think of it like a a theoretical physics book. You won't understand it if nobody have you real life examples.Author talks off too much content. Everybody knows like hard work, dedication, determination. In the end I don't think anybody would be able to remember things from this book or apply them. He has given like 50 points etc. etc.Though at a page or two you have think you can take and even if one learns from this single page it's worth it. But in all it's clunky and just talks of theory, instead if you will read some autobiography where you can follow the life of protagonist you will gain much more."

Same is the case with this book."
84,Shephine Shaji,Cliched,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book is for those who have found themselves to be major admirers of the self-help gurus that inspire the common folk with emotional appeals on how to be among the top 1%. Stopped it after a few pages because thought processes are incoherent. Let me say this: any book that says to keep trying till you succeed  is a scam. At least from the first few pages, this was the impression I received about what the author was trying to say. In life, one must know when to give up too. Luck, whether you like it, or not, plays a huge part too. Any book that says otherwise just giving you sweet lies instead of the bitter truths. Don't pick this up."
85,Amazon Customer,A bit boring but overall good,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have read this book but could complete it as it is a bit boring. As a newbie to reading pretty dissatisfied

Good passing read though!"

89,Saahi Burgujar,Uninteresting,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  To be honest, I never finished this book. It was vague and uninteresting. I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. Although there were some useful points (one or two) other than that it was a waste of time."
90,Anand T.R.,Think Before You Buy This Book,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Let me start this review by giving 6 out of the 5 stars I have (Yes, I borrowed a star from a friend of mine) to Amazon. Amazon is the best, always.About the publisher : Amazing Reads. This is my first ever book from Amazing Reads, and I am surely impressed. A very well made book for a very modest price. But there is only one thing that struck me very hard. Among the publication details of the book given on the second page, just after the profile of the author, there is a passage which goes on to say that  this book is based on the copyright free version of the title and only uses extracted material from the 1937 edition of the original book. This was a big let down for me for the following two reasons : 1) It is ""based"" on the original work ! That is a big disappointment. I would have never ordered a book the purpose or the objective of it is to explain another book, when that another book is a Self help book. In a way, you are buying another book to help you with a Self help book, which is really weird. Though this could be my own issue. 2) It uses ""extracts"" from the original work ! Is not this a dilution or may be aggrandizement of the points mentioned in the original work ? There is another element of subjectivity added in this book by the person who extracted material from the original work by adding fillers and materials to fill in the voids and gaps, so that the whole essence may be there, but the objectivity of the original author is lost. May be the publisher should have put in the message on the first page rather than on the not so conspicuous second page which I suppose might not have been noticed by thousands of people. So the publisher gets : 3/5About the book : The context in which this book was written was post Great Depression of 1929-30, or 1937 to be exact. Have the secrets to success since then changed ? Do men need the mantras mentioned in this book to survive a fast changing environment embracing us ? There are many questions such as these which you feel rising within yourselves the moment you reach the crucial portions of the book. While I wouldn't disregard the tricks and tips mentioned in this book altogether, but some points seem out of place and highly irrelevant today. Also there is the fact that  very terrible jingoist proclamations seem to be hidden in some passages which try to scream out of the pages the greatness of the American folk. The ""rant"" against trade union movements also seem somewhat biased. I am not particularly surprised since the author openly vows his support for the capitalist economy and all that it stands for. I, personally didn't seem to connect with any of the ""secrets to success"" mentioned in the book. The blame largely lies on me, since the book wants you to follow the steps mentioned in it to achieve all that it claims. And unless and until you follow the book diligently, the blame for your failures lies solely on you.The book is not entirely unhelpful. Some ideas here and there do seem to have an impact on you. But on the whole, the book falls short of the binding impact and force you would expect from such a kind of book. This was my first self help book and I must say I have grown immune to them. So like the heading, if you have already read a self help book and found it useful, go for this, else ponder over the headline of this review."
91,Nitin Bhandarkar,Very cumbersome,2.0 out of 5 stars,  200 odd pages of sermon...i found it good only in pieces. Second half of the book was too laborious to read.

93,Amazon Customer,Lost in the middle,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Very interesting to read at the start till middle of the book, but somewhere it lost afterwards, in phases it was inspiring."

95,bharthi,"Good cover page, bad paper quality, very low inspiration quotes.",2.0 out of 5 stars,  Its not a too much of inspiration boom. So before buy it.
96,Anup S,Not soo bad.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Good book but the issue is with the quality of the pages used.
97,Sagar,Awful Read...,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  ""Think And Grow Rich"", by Napoleon Hill, originally published in 1937, paved way to the  genre of Self Help and Get-Rich books. Subsequently a multitudinous of Self Help and Grow-Rich books were published.  By the title ""Think and Grow Rich"" the author is not talking about your mental growth but you growing rich literally. I presumed that the book is all about you mental growth, but I was wrong.------------------------------------------------------------The book is divided into 14 chapters viz.1.Desire2.Faith3.Auto-Suggestion4.Specialized Knowledge5.Imagination6.Organized Planning7.Decision8.Persistence9.Power of The Master Mind10.The Mystery of Sex Transmutation11.The Subconscious Mind12.The Brain13.The Sixth Sense14.How to Outwit the Six Ghosts of FearThe book is 331 pages long-----------------------------------------------------------------The book offers nothing new. It's is an obsolete piece of work. In the beginning of the book Hill writes that if you doubt his wisdom then his wisdom won't work for you. Hill is asking the reader to accept the fact that the reader should suspend his disbelief for this book to work for the reader. In the first chapter Hill talks about how his son was born deaf and without any natural way to perceive sound. The doctors were rendered helpless but against all odds, like a miracle(a miracle it is), the boy found a way to overcome his disability. One might wonder how such a thing is possible. Hill made it possible by instilling DESIRE in to his sons heart. A Desire to hear, a desire to prove others (others who said it's impossible ) wrong, a desire to WIN against all odds. This description of his life's event makes one wonder wether he is truthful or deceitful.I didn't enjoy the book, I couldn't even stomach finishing it. The book is dull, highly repetitive. One can read the title and the first page of every chapter and can skip through the rest without losing the gist.To summarise this review I'd like to recite a story. I had a teacher, who is loved by every one for her class except few people like me. Her notion of ""driving home the idea"", is to repeat an important point again and again. For instance if she wants us to memorise about the Independence day she would go like this:India got independence in Aug 15th 1947 X5( repeats 5 times)When did India get Independence?? Aug 15th 1947 X 7What happened on Aug 15 1947? X3India got Independence X 5So when did India get independence??Aug 15, 1947 X 10 timesAnnoyed??? I know.... Such is the annoyance this book gives you. The author has nothing new to offer and choses to brag about the same idea again and again. Like some one in the review section already mentioned, pls don't buy a book based on the reviews. And if you want to buy something,let alone a book, from Amazon,do check 3-1 stars reviews some of them are honest.--------------------------------------------------------------------I hope this helps.... Thanks for you time."
98,Amazon Customer,tough reading,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Really tough to read as the writing was set in the late 1930's....hard to inculcate the chapters in real life, as some of them have no relevance in today's world..was a waste of time..tough reading comprehension.."
99,K B GESUDARAJ,Nothing is there,2.0 out of 5 stars,  waste. Wasted money
100,Tanya,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Sorry, but there are tons of books out there that get the same message across in a much more inspiring manner. Chapter one tells you that there is a hidden secret that is an ongoing theme in all the chapters, but he won't tell you what it is. I suspect there isn't one, and that bit is to get you to keep reading. Then the rest of the book is him telling you outdated stories of the way things were in his time. Like even if you aren't qualified for a job, if you really want it you can hop on a train and convince the boss to give you the job anyway just by being persistent and insisting he hire you. Sorry, just not the way things work anymore. Apparently rich old guys love this book, probably because it reminds them of they way things used to be, and supports their theory that young people just aren't being persistent enough, rather than the fact that boomers ruined our economy.I rarely give negative reviews on amazon but this book fully deserves it. Go find something more current."
101,Iselaski,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Despite of it’s popularity, the book was a hard read as it is not well written and one can get lost in the point the author is making. I heard it is used by Law of attraction aficionados almost like a wisdom book. I found nothing like that here, so best to look for alternatives if you want wisdom. Don’t believe the hype"
102,T. Gokce,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  A good read but nothing to getting really appreciate or get excited about! Too much waffle
103,WILHELMINA SHAKESPEARE,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Seemed quite interesting at first but got tedious and I gave up with it. Very American.
104,Samantha ,,2.0 out of 5 stars,   Disappointed this was a gift and it came damaged and worn as if it had been pre owned
105,F. Hensel,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't get me wrong. The book seems to be great. I haven't read it all now but I like what I have read already.The physical quality of the book though is terrible. The cover is made of very thin carton. And the layout is even worse. It appears as if someone just coppied the text from a PDF and put it into a book. Often times they even forgot to delete the page numbers from the original text and so they appear within 45 46 the text. I cannot believe, someone actually dares to be so lazy and still makes money with it."
106,mrs k longford,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  One of those books you're told you have to read. Hard going. Not for me
107,JP,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Couldn't quite get into it but picked out some useful information. Chapter 2 is my favourite as it is inspiring.
108,Master J Haden-Jones,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Full of of cliche' rubbish - may have been good once, but has not held up in the test of time."
109,Tolar,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Great book in a horrible format. Get a different edition for yourself.
110,alr,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not very helpful, there are much better books out there with more useful content."
111,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book had a strong beginning and ending, but it felt like a whole lot of filler in between. I know this was written a long time ago, but some of the sexist comments were hard to get past."
112,Mahmud Sultan arif,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Quality not good
113,Favor,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The written words are too tiny to read.I will need reading glasses to be able to read.
114,A. Carpenter,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  If you like it, fine, but it wasn't for me. I found the religious sentiment a bit too much & chapter.3 was torturous to read & it just seemed to go downhill from there.Anyone who reads this needs to take into account when it was written as some of the writing style feels like it is from an age long gone.It your one of those types who can get into those ""Believe & you will do it! Harness the power of the positive mind"" type books, MAYBE you'll kind this useful.But let me put it this way, if you read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" & then read this, you might find it hard to take it seriously."
115,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The only substance thing I got out of it was the blueprint to the steps to indicating how much you want to make and making that happened. The rest of the book was just fillers where the author just goes in circle. I think this book caters to younger audience or for those who needs pep talk
116,Stephan W.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book itself is nice. However, this digital edition is full of scanning/conversion errors. Within two chapters it happened three times to me that I couldn't even understand the sense of a mistyped word in context so it definitely hasn't undergone any editorial review. Too bad for a nice book."
117,roy raviv,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got the audio version. the book lists some common sense principals but is unable to give you any tools or suggestions as to how to apply these principles in every-day life. It is an old book that is not adapted to today's reality. I guess the title pretty much sums it up - if you think that you can grow rich you will grow rich...and that's just not good enough.
118,Amazon Kunde,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Eigentlich ein gutes Buch mit gutem Inhalt, aber die Abschrift ist nicht zu verzeihen. Manche Sätze sind schwer nachzuvollziehen und teilweise sind auch viele Fehler vorhanden."
119,Pierre Joseph,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The book had a big knife scratch
120,so,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Il semblerait que même dans cette version il manque des parties essentielles de la première édition de Napoleon Hill. De ce fait je suis sceptique.
121,Donald,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I am not going to complain about the edition as most of the negative reviews for this book I actually did not enjoy this book.Perhaps being a self-help book it's not suposse to be enjoyable rather than helpful but for me it lacked in both. Although Napoleon Hill does seem to have put a considerable effort in studying the subject of how to becme rich (this is main idea of the book), I expected to find in it more than just tactics of how to make your mind think rich and you will somehow become rich.Perhaps what he is suggesting does work, who knows.. but I am confident that the vast majority of its audience will never practice what he is proposing that you do.."
122,My Books,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Its not the content that lets it down, its clumsy format of the paperback.Although the book has famous advocates, there is no evidence of a meeting between Hill and Andrew Carnegie, not even in the Wiki article about Carnegie. In all the videos on YT about Carnegie's history, Hill does not get a mention."
123,Molten Beaks,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I'm sure this book, in its day, inspired a generation of people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and get the most out of life.But for me it was just strangely written. Trying to look beyond the obvious anachronisms (eg, a partial chapter explaining the fortune to be made in the new world of radio) some of it just felt a bit strange. Like using willpower to overcome being deaf. I'm a skeptic generally, but the content and general tone of this book, I think, has simply been eclipsed. I couldn't be bothered to finish it."
124,Eyenorth,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Written nicely, yes. However, there were a couple of things which bothered me, eg. a fragment that success doesn't require sarcifice, a massive emphasis on desire or Napoleon's absolute lack of empathy for his disabled son. Those reasons made me do some research on the author. What I found out was just ridiculous.It turned out that Oliver N. Hill never had a successfull business, never earned a penny legally and was on the run from the law for most of his life for shady deals and scam businesses. By the way, he started to use his second name, Napoleon, to confuse the authorities. There is no evidence he has ever met Andrew Carnegie. Interestingly, he started to boast about the mission given by Carnegie many years after his death.He met his to-be-wife, Florence, while executing one of his scams, the automobile college. After they married he pretty much leeched money out of Florence's wealthy family. When the money was gone, he abandoned his wife. For most of their marriage he kept her close only when it was convenient.It is true that Oliver N. Hill was successfull but the foundation was not hard work. He gained his fame through selling disgusting lies to people who only want to improve their wellfare. I will not take any advice from such a scam as Napoleon Hill."
125,DAS,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have always believed that positive belief will get you to where you want to be, reading this book has changed by thoughts dramatically , it will certainly enhance my relationship with money and will change my personal life for sure, Nothing is impossible , Henry ford backed his lifetime dream and proved what is possible if you have true desire and never give up on your idea the sky really can be your limit, Thomas Eddison dreaming of a lamp and making it a reality,  despite others negativity to such a mad idea, visualisation and believing so badly that you can make a dream come true, i must say is awe inspring. The chapter on desire outwits mother nature moved me so much, a mother myself i could not imagine the worry for that little baby born without hearing , his fathers faith and belief that he would not be a deaf mute was unshakeable.. I have got so much from this already but now know that the only limitations you may face are in your mind and guess what you put it there , opportunities for greatness are within you.  I will be revisiting these chapters & reading it again as suggested."
126,GRACE,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  not impressed
127,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I don't understand what all the fuss is about.Pretentious, pseudo-scientific, badly written and structured, riddled with typos.I could only stomach through the first three chapters before I decided to start reading something else.I was expecting something in the vein of Carnegie's Hot to Win Friends, something well researched and clearly presented, but I found the opposite.My advice: start your journey towards growing rich by not spending any money on this book."
128,Carmacon,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Über den Inhalt wurde hier schon ausgiebig geschrieben. Das Buch an sich besteht aus normalem 80 g/m² Druckerpapier und wurde vermutlich in Word getippt. Das Layout ist eine Katastrophe, zudem sind Schlagworte und Betonungen in Großbuchstaben gedruckt, sodass manche Seiten zu gefühlten 50% aus GROSSBUCHSTABEN bestehen. SO schreibt man doch KEIN BUCH! Ich habe damals 4,85 € dafür bezahlt, drum ist das ganze noch zu verschmerzen."
129,Sarah Pearce,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's a good read and teaches you to never give up but in all honesty it is the most appallingly written book I have ever read and I'm an English teacher. The punctuation and grammar make me have nervous twitches. Whoever edited this book needs firing immediately! Only giving it two stars for the content, otherwise it would be one!"
130,lokue,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not sure what happened to this book pages came loose couldn't read so threw it away
131,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Disappointed and took a long time to get into.Delivery was quick.
132,soulsista79,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  never finished reading this
133,Rosie,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  some good ideas, mainly way too many exclamation marks"
134,M.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I wonder if the edition contain an original text of Hill... unfortunately I have no comparison since it is the only edition I have. It looks like it was edited by a primary school pupil. I was hoping for an original text of Napoleon Hill... I think it may be simply noncarefully rewritten text... Unfortunately I started to read it to late to be able to sent it back.  is very pity for me but I would not recommend buying it.
135,Jay,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Don't know how you would implement this. Nice idea though.
136,john,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  letters to small an average book
137,MR_Mahlow,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Eindeutig ""falsches Jahrhundert"". Mit diesen ""Tipps"" lockt man heute keinen Hund mehr hinter dem Kanonenofen hervor. Definitiv nicht mehr zeitgemäß."
138,anamaria,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The book arrived quickly and in great condition. I just couldn't get into it.Don't like the way its written.
139,John,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This has got to be one of the most hyped books ever. I must say, I was disappointed. Before I bought it, I was wondering how something written in 1937 could still be relevant today. I was right to wonder! He has a very long-winded, rambling style, that gets tedious really quickly. I think the only chapter I got any sort of benefit from was the first, where the take-away message was: if you want to be successful, you have to be determined and persistent. The rest of the book has already faded from my memory."
140,Te,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  boring, too much arounds"
141,StandiMC,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The content itself is really good but this published edition is all over the shop- spelling mistakes, poor print quality. Definitely read but don't get this one, as it's likely you'll want to refer back to it!"
142,loredana marian-bowker,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The cover of the book was damaged and there is a lot of writing/scribbling inside the book by whoever had it previously.... I thought I was buying a new book?! I just have to stop myself from paying attention to the 'notes' next to the paragraphs while I'm reading.. Who and why writes over texts in books!!? It is not something you do and then sell the book. As for the contents of the book, it sounds encouraging (if only I can get past the distraction of the notes!)"
143,Ein Kunde,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Think & Grow Rich ist ein überragendes Buch. Nur leider nicht diese Ausgabe!Scheinbar wurde der Originaltext per Hand abgetippt oder diktiert; anders kann ich es mir nicht erklären, dass mitten in den Sätzen Zahlen auftauchen und Satzzeichen den Sinn ganzer Satzstrukturen zerstören.Sätze wie ""[...] as it 12 13 was conceived and carried out [...]"" sind keine Seltenheit.Außerdem ist der Text außerordentlich klein = viel Text pro Seite, was es im Vergleich zu anderen Versionen schwerer macht, das Wesen der Philosophien und das der einzelnen Ideen zu überblicken. Es gibt pro Seite viel zu verdauen.Ich empfehle allen, die Napoleon Hill's opus magnum mit Genuss studieren möchten, die Ausgabe 

Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised

  .Diese Ausgabe wird dem Original nicht gerecht, tun Sie sich einen Gefallen und machen Sie um diese Edition ein Bogen."
144,Zach,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Believe it or not Facebook was invented 5 years before this book was written. Please enjoy a carefully curated selection of  rant-like statuses and posts possibly made by an extremely self assured high schooler living in the early 1900's made public and sold for profit.Selections include:Assorted Ramblings on Magic Crystal TechnologyNo Nut November Your Way to SuccessHow to Fight Satan (And Win!)A Bibliography of Cited Works (Just kidding! By the eighth or ninth time Mr. Hill tells you to trust him and that he's studied thousands of people [sometimes in all capital letters!], you'll basically have the same thing.)And other gems which are sometimes rudely interrupted by the overarching theme of ""hey if you try really hard all the time you'll actually have a chance at increasing the probability of getting what you want.""No thank you, Mr. Hill, please tell me more about the magical ether and infinite intelligence of the universe in all caps again.Honestly some reasonable albeit somewhat common sense advice is found in here (alongside some loopy stuff), but if you like books that are actually readable, this isn't what you're looking for."
145,Zachary,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Disclaimer: I couldn't even finish.To give credit where's it's due: There are moments in this book that make you stop and think, and there are a few step-by-step lists you can follow but everything in here can be found for free on YouTube.Problem 1: It constantly gives the impression that it's a bunch of nonsense. I was IMMEDIATELY turned off by the mention of ""the secret"" extremely early on (either in the introduction or in chapter one, I can't remember exactly) and how I'm going to have this revelatory moment when it hits me all at once and how my life will change. It tainted the rest of the reading for me and made everything hard to take seriously. I gave it my best shot though because this book was recommended by a YouTuber I highly respect.Problem 2: It's very vague about things that should be very clear. For a book that's about boiling down the similarities amongst rich people, you don't really get many concrete facts. You don't know what books they read, their investment strategies, their perspectives on things like real estate vs stocks or anything like that. You get ""desire,"" ""auto-suggestion,"" and other stuff that's just really not all that helpful from a practical standpoint. To give credit where it's due, there are a few lists that the author put in this book that are helpful if you follow the steps, but like I said earlier, I realized I could get more out of free inspirational YouTube videos/channels about journaling and growing as a person than I could out of this book in way less time.Problem 3: This is more of an opinion but I personally did not enjoy the writing style. It might be because it was tainted early on with talk of ""the secret"" but the ""voice"" of the book just didn't sit well with me. It felt like I was listening to someone who had genuinely good intentions and wanted to help me, but what they were saying was just not helpful or impactful. If these ideas were being spoken to me by someone I'd be rolling my eyes secretly a lot.Problem 4: I get the feeling that you're better off reading biographies of the people he mentions in the book than reading the tidbits you get. For instance, you get a couple paragraphs on Charles Schwab and his role in the steel industry. Instead of getting a tiny bit of the story used as supporting evidence for the case made by the author, you're probably better off just reading about Charles Schwab.Problem 5: The book (the half I read) could really be summed up a lot more succinctly. Desire wealth almost to the point of insanity, figure out how much wealth you want, figure out what you'd do as a job to get that wealth, get your foot in the door, outsource work you can't already do to other people who can already do it, etc.Notice, no mention of how to get the capital to start a new business, no mention how banks work, no mention of interest rates, no mention of anything outside of what you, the individual reading, can control with your M I N D. Desire, faith, auto-suggestion, inspiration... like no dude I need to know how loans work, what's good debt contrasted with bad debt, how do you manage risk, what's a good investment portfolio makeup for a person in this, that, and another situation.I guess to sum up, it's title is too revealing. The word THINK carries far too much weight and the book is so biased in the direction of what you can dream of and make up/control with your mind that it fails to deal with other aspects of being/growing rich while promising the mind is all you need.I don't understand how in the world this book is so highly-rated/praised in general. I guess I just don't get ""the secret."" 😂"
146,John,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I reviewed another version of Think and Grow Rich, which is far superior in quality to this one. This is in terms of size (this version is much more compact, but some people might appreciate that) and the text is bolder and a little distorted, as well as being smaller. It might just be a matter of preference, but I prefer the other one. Regardless, it can only be a good thing for the world to have as many copies of Think and Grow Rich in circulation as possible!Note: This review refers to the white and green version in the included photo."
147,MountainT,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book at first was written pretty convincing, but after reading it for a while it just gets worse and worse. All the informations are misleading and too repetitive, the stories seems like essays written by kids pieced together. The book could be a lot shorter and the language and tone for the book is too serious. Most of the teachings taught in the book is pretty outdated."
148,westin,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was researching books to read to help guide me in the path of becoming more successful. This book came up almost every where I went and has been a best seller since the 1930s. So I got it and was soon asking myself, ""What the hell is he talking about?"" It was written in the 30s so be ready for that first off. Secondly it pretty much just talks about how successful people are successful because they thought about being successful and made it happen. That's it. The title literally tells you what the book is about. Think you're rich, and you will grow rich. It might work for some people but I was left feeling like I wasted my time."
149,Pou Madden,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I felt like the book was repetitive and did not clearly spell out what the secret to success is. I read a few chapters and it got boring to me. But I like that the price was under $7.
150,M.A. Cox,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Most of the negative reviews I saw on my skim-through said that content had been removed from this version of the book. Even if that content had been restored, though, I doubt it would have improved the issues throughout.Some of it IS good - the leadership section is fantastic and I really liked the job seeking advice, some of which is parroted by reputable sources today. His predictions on industry behavior in everything other than journalism is sound in its argument even 80 years later. (Facebook would have blown Napoleon Hill's mind!) It seems like every time I hit one of those sections, though, I'd go into something else that would negate it. Hill suggests personal desire can be transmuted into its physical equivalent throughout the book, but that personal desire must be unfaltering and from within, adhering to his 13 steps. I wouldn't have cast doubt on any of that, but all his instructions are imperative (do it his way, exactly, or it's completely your fault) and backed up with vague authority and ""common sense."" He also backs it up with real-life examples, but some of these are questionable at best.For example, Hill illustrates decisiveness through Samuel Adams making a decision not to accept a bribe, thus ensuring his vision of a country free of tyranny. I could have accepted that story as an example of other traits, but decisiveness? This could be contorted to fit even if the opposite happened: by remaining loyal to King George's demands, Adams transmuted his personal desires into wealth and upheld his vision of a British empire. Obviously, this is not true, and subject to historical supposition, but it's a poor example and is just one instance of Hill's hero worship that pervades the book.There was a personal example of Hill's son, born deaf, who overcame his disability to become a productive member of society. This would have been an inspiring story, but Hill reveals that he socially manipulates his son's teachers to give him advantages, and even incepts the desire to hear into his son (through a form of tactile speech). So, the desires you wish to apply to Hill's methodology need to be innate, but if your parents want it instead, that's apparently good enough. (There was another example where a parent ""helped along"" their child, so this isn't purely against Hill's family relationships.)Most of his lessons feel shoe-horned into the book just like that. When the book takes a turn to the spiritual near the end chapters, he focuses on how fears manifest themselves into reality. According to Hill, illness and baldness can be avoided entirely because doctors and hatless men do not succumb to fear. It has nothing to do with sanitation or genetics - it's bravery!The pseudoscience, formality of language, and horrible organization of the book (requiring back-and-forth throughout chapters to recall referenced lessons) would have made this book daunting to read in any form, but the Kindle version has a few scan errors to further complicate matters. Of course, not having my brain vibrate at a frequency to accept this book's message is my fault for reading it too fast; Hill suggests taking in the whole book over the course of a year, internalizing each chapter as it comes up. I paced myself as best I could, wanting to absorb its themes in a way that could improve my standing, but I still managed to complete the book a couple of months after I started reading. I wanted this thing over and done with.There are probably better versions of this book out there, and I may give a free version a read-through to pick up on the reputedly omitted material. Bottom line, though, it's not worth purchasing this book for anything other than the job-hunting advice. At least the best way to earn money hasn't changed after all these years: be happy with wages, and keep dreaming of windfalls."
151,Nicole Krause,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This book is pretty short. It could be way shorter! It makes some valid points but they are stated 5761 times. I typically read 3 books a week. It took me 3 weeks to read this book. I often fell asleep.
152,Tasha Mac,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I have the book Think and Grow Rich and wanted something to keep me grounded when im on mobile. I thought this book as a good idea but i was so disappointed. It  is only a review of the chapters and i doubt it was half an hour long. Well probable. The summary can be helpful but I expected more
153,Jill,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have to admit, I didn't finish this book. I just lost interest. It's very old so when there are racially and/or disability-insensitive anecdotes, I just have to grit my teeth and remember ""different times""... But really, Mr. Hill keeps referring to ""the secret"" and how you may understand it in the second chapter or in the last chapter, but eventually you will get it. And honestly, it just sounds like the Emperor's new clothes.To be fair, there are also explicit instructions for how you can write your goals down and then repeat them to yourself in the mirror. I haven't tried this yet but might still. It's free on Kindle so the most you have to lose is your time."
154,Cameron,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The way he dances around his central premise, never stating it outright, is a transparent cop-out meant to make his theory un-testable."
155,SG,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this book based on reviews but as some of them have mentioned there might be different versions of this book. The one that i got has a lot of typos and seems like an older version. Wouldn't recommend this book.
156,edgardo olvera,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Conversely to the majority of people thinking that this is a great book, I was quite disappointed.Kindle version is outdated, I think this is like one of the first editions of this book. Also, sometimes I feel the author goes back and forth between concepts all over the book chapters.It is a good one but not as great as I was expecting."
157,Shabrish M.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This wasn’t what I expected. It’s outdated, too superficial in some cases and ideal for those who are looking for elementary guide."
158,M. King,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There is one piece of advice this whole book is constructed around and it is a good one. To obtain something, you must focus on it and let it permeate you entirely. By doing this, even when you aren't aware of it, you will be making choices that help move you towards your goal. Those thousands of decisions made in pursuit of a certain end will help you get there.That's great, and I believe it to be true. Napoleon Hill is crazy, though. He ascribes powerful belief with essentially supernatural ability. By really, really, believing it would get better, he is convinced he cured his sons deafness. In his world, you basically use force of will to bend reality to your whim and then god or something like god will take care of things for you. It's ridiculous, and it holds no place in a thinking persons philosophy.There is something to be said for setting goals, and single minded dedication. Perhaps at one point this idea was novel enough to give the book a pass, but it's been expanded and elaborated upon in the decades since, and this book is filled with too much jibberish to recommend today."
159,Melanie A. Olson,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Searching for ""Think and Grow Rich"", I was kind of annoyed to find so many versions to choose from; I didn't know which to pick. I read about several and took their reviews and stars into consideration. I downloaded this book over the other ones primarily because of this phrase in its advertising: ""This Ebook Features Amazing Dynamic Chapter Link Navigation for a Premium Reading Experience."" On my Kindle, this did not turn out to be true at all. In fact, this is the most difficult book to navigate of all books I've ever had on my Kindle. If I had known it was going to be like this, I would not have downloaded it. The only reason it's getting two stars instead of one is because of the audio. I have not yet accessed the audio to see if they work, however. But assuming they do, I am sure I will eventually appreciate having them. But only a few minutes after buying this version and discovering it's horrible to navigate, I went back and downloaded a different version of this book. I could not see a way to get a refund on this one. Good thing they were both only $0.99."
160,Mr A C Humphreys,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Data and information was as excpected - BUT - - - as a paperback, the page size and the text were too small to read with comfort.  I gave the paperback to a friend and ordered 2 additional copies as hardcover.Napolean Hill has written a very important book with inspiration to move forward with your life... not just about getting RICH.  I substitute ""quality of life"" for every sentence that is based upon ""money"" or ""rich"".This is good reading for many."
161,A Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The whole positive thinking thing promoted by Hill is fine.  However, it did not do much for Hill, himself.His life was pretty much a mess from a relationship and financial perspective.Positive thinking is a must, but without direct, positive ACTION, not much is accomplished."
162,CR,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Hears a better summary of this book.  Use your brain - think - brainstorm about ideas of what you could do to earn a living - start a new business - etc.  Your mind is capable of imagining all kinds of new ventures that can make you prosperous without any ""hocus pocus"", but a lot of hard but enjoyable work."
163,A.J.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  ...then it's as though you drunk uncle gets up to make an unsolicited toast at your wedding. He just rambles on and on and on....
164,tulga,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I did not like this. Pages were very cheap and easy to be torn.
165,Greg Hoffman,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I guarantee this book started the entire system of trying to channel the universe to get what you want in life movement.The whole ""secret"" crowd who think about what they want and it just magically comes to them non-sense people seem to have this book as ground zero for their work.I don't quite think thats the purpose of this book, but it makes a lot of bold claims about getting rich and wealthy that I don't really think do much but mentally J you off. It feels good to think like this but in reality does it help? I dunno"
166,Rising Star 757,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  $5,000,000 dollars. That's how much I'm going to initially raise for my company. I am going to do it by using the Think and Grow Rich method as laid out in Napoleon Hill's ORIGINAL book. Don't get an amended, annotated, updated or otherwise diluted book. Get the original. And get the best version of the original.This is an important tool for making your dream into reality. Get the best quality tool. Get the Black Leather-bound Gold-gilded version for just a few bucks more. The quality difference is worth it. Here is the link the the best version of this book: 

Think and Grow Rich: Teaching for the First Time, the Famous Andrew Carnegie Formula for Money-Making, Based Upon the Thirteen Proven Steps to Riches

Read my review attached to the Deluxe Black leather bound version. That book is a workbook. It needs to hold up to being put to work.God speed in making your dream into reality! (even if you don't know what your dream is yet)."
167,Goobyfan27m,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Some helpful ideas but mostly nonsense. These antiquated ideas won't get you any wealth, no matter how hard you try to follow them."
168,Ex Texan,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Rambled too much and no new information, just expounding on what most magazine stories say..."
169,Travis Winn,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Amazing book, but the layout is 8 x 11"" so it's not like reading a normal book (like the original version of this book I had.  I was very disappointed when I got it like a schoolbook instead of a small paperback.`"
170,Deb,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Over priced repeats things too much. Over priced
171,Zachary Clendenen,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The author constantly repeats the same arguments and points over and over again.
172,Gislene,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I got the wrong version! I wanted the one with the cover just like it displayed on the picture but instead got the old version of Think and Grow Rich. Of course I have read and reread the book but wanted this new version that has larger printing... oh well! I guess I will have to give it to someone and try again.
173,Lucky,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I felt it is too boring. It took very long time to finish it. At the end I felt the same as before I read the book.
174,James Speirs,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  A few decent ideas but wildly overrated and outdated. Worth reading for a laugh but overall bit of a waste of time.
175,Shells,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered this book on the belief it would be inspiration and uplifting.  I found it to be out of date.  However, it comes so highly recommended, I will read it again in hopes of gaining some insight.  I can get the meaning behind the messages, just found it a slow read."
176,Susan Huey,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  the book itself is great, however, YOU CAN ACQUIRE THIS SAME BOOK ONLINE FOR  FREE!  not a joke either, just do a G search"
177,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought this on the recommendation of a friend, but stopped reading after about 1/4. Reads like a cheap infomercial. Happy I only paid 99 cents."
178,Josh,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was sadly disappointed. This book has such an outstanding reputation of being life changing  and timeless. I was thoroughly intrigued the first few chapters, but after a while I felt like there was an abundance of filler and fluff. Most of the information was reaching in between the few useful stories of Ford or Edison. I found myself wanting to skim the second half of the book. There was just a lack of content that was actually about the theme or purpose of the book.Too many lists; the 8 of this to avoid, the 12 steps for success, the 15 laws of this, 6 basic fears, the 57 famous alibis, etc, etc. Too many rambling stories. I hope ""The Power of Habit"" or ""The Secret"" live up to their reputations."
179,Theodore Didday,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  the problem is just that the hyphens - are still in the book from the old edition!
180,Jacob Cartwright,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  As self help books go, this one comes in on the entry level. The market is flooded with this material. Shop around. I am not convinced the sole focus on greed will bear much fruit, except for the publisher."
181,Hyunkyung,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The font is too small. Tiring on the eyes.
182,walter henson,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Print is way too small to read
183,Cleo,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The type was too small.  I am not going to return, I will just be more careful in the future when I order books.  Otherwise a great book."
184,joy rigdon,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Got few good pointer's from the book but not very useful
185,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  it looks like all of the pages were never cut and someone took a butterknife and cut the pages open. The book itself is a great book, but the pages are in terrible shape. For a used book, I would not consider this a book in good condition. I wish the seller would have mentioned this before I purchased it."
186,D. Hall,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was hoping for the unabridged version of TAGR, but this one is very much abridged.  It was ok, but not great."
187,Yasue,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This may be a highly recommended book in spite of its age, but I was bored to death by it. I'm not sure if it's due to the long-winded writing of the era (1937) or that it read like a sales pitch even though it clearly has no product attached. A lot of finance books read like sales pitches. In any case, there are a lot of good summaries out there for free, so don't waste a penny unless you want to take a nap."
188,Roxy L.,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I was encouraged to read this from a professor many years ago. Got around to reading it and found it boring. Got around to reading it again and found it boring and dated. Gets more interesting at the end, but not that much so."
189,Kindle Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Too much reference to the bible. Was annoying to read. Felt like a sermon.
190,Mikey,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  A bit too obvious
191,Raven K,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This book is full of solid concepts. That said, many of the anecdotes simply don't line up - often, causation is assumed from purely mental processes. Faced with the claims given in this book, one could believe that Hill is a mental alchemist, able to transmute matter into gold with nothing more than the power of thought.There's some spectacular content in this book, but it's been around long enough that the worthwhile content is available elsewhere in far more readable form."
192,Alex Corrales,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought this Kindle book almost 2 weeks ago & I'm overall disappointed with the Kindle version. The book itself is a classic, Napoleon Hill hit the ¨proverbial head on the nail¨ with his book. Its the lack of features on this Kindle edition that could use some improvements.For the price, I got what I paid for. Nonetheless, I wish I paid the extra money for edition that with a Table of Contents that take me directly to a chapter or with actual illustrations. I just finished Chap. 3 & so far I have seen no illustrations as the electronic title says. All in all, this is simply a very basic version of the classic ¨Think & Grow Rich¨ for the Kindle. Nothing more."
193,Alisa,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not much content. This is a 45 minute or so audio recording.
194,David Allen,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Eh not anything different
195,Kindle Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This should have been a pamphlet.  There's an awful lot of fluff in here as well as a few obviously contrived / falsified examples - like his deaf son's desire to hear manifesting itself in the form of an early hearing aid (ignoring his well to do father's connections) and the Chinese exchange student who says the thing he noticed about America is that our eyes are slanted the wrong way.  There are some nuggets, to be sure, but they're not really worth the dig.That said, it was free."
196,Lancer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  You only need to read titles of each chapter and you basically know what's in the book. No secret path to rich as it described.
197,bec56,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book arrived in great condition as expected which is the only reason I even rated it 2 stars.  I was looking for a restored copy of the original text.  I didn't realize this was revised, I misread the description. The revision takes God out of the book and substitutes infinite intelligence instead, this was not the author's intention and I find it a horrendous and offensive substitution."
198,Sam Bates,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book is great, the principles are fundamental. But the revision, or whomever wrote this into e format is an idiot. Typos galore and it discredits the entirety of the book."
199,andton,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Needs to be updated...seems like old information.....mailed in a paper envelope, no case"
200,Freedom Rider,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not what I expected.  Very limited value.
201,Amazon Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The font is too small. It's practically 2 pages for every 1 page due to the small font. Tiring on the eyes.

203,Kim G. Boyd,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The book was torn and in bad shape and they stated that it was next to new and in really good shape. However, the book is excellent."
204,Louise B,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is obviously a very popular read and has been for years and years. However, I have a problem with it. He lists things you must do to achieve what it is you're after, step by step. The problem for me is, he says after each step that if you don't follow this exactly and leave any step out, YOU WILL FAIL! One of my subconscious beliefs is that I will fail. My H.S. Latin teacher gave me that one when he skipped me from giving out a final exam, and when I mentioned it, he said "" You don't need one. You'll just fail it anyway.""Well, that stuck (I'm 61 now) and seeing that in this book just screams at me, ""You Will Fail"" and I see none of the positive points he's making. I just believe that if I miss doing this exactly right, I will fail.So if you have failure thoughts you're trying to get past, I would skip this read."
205,mm2011,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Wasting of time. Another self improvement book going through same things like most of those kind of books. I don't know I didn't find anything new and inspiring beside several good stories. If you want to help yourself spend time mastering something conplicated that takes years to master and just be consistent.
206,Royce,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  He lost me when he started talking about his imaginary friends in the later chapters. This book is renowned by so many self help gurus, but it just wasn't for me. There's more to getting rich than just thinking about it and hoping it happens."
207,Michael,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This print of this great book is filled with spelling errors to the point of annoyance.Thus for those who prefer a level of quality, please purchase another cover version"
208,Kimberly S,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The book was advertised as NEW on Amazon and it definitely is not new.  The cover is very creased and the pages are bent.  I would not buy from this seller again.
209,pgsaltydog,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Perhaps it is shame on me, for I thought I was getting a narration by Earl Nightingale of the ENTIRE book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill."
210,Pro User,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is a great book, but be ye warned: this hardcover edition is typeset in an uncomfortable-to-read, large-ish (maybe 12 or 13 pt) San Serif typeface.My recommendation is to save yourself the hassle of an inevitable return and buy a different edition. I returned this one and bought an older hardcover edition that is eminently more beautiful and enjoyable readable."
211,Fab,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  This starts up in a quicktime file format with a warning that there is a problem with the format. Then after a few minutes the device goes to sleep and the audiobook stops.
212,jaguars80,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Great book.  But the book's condition not so great.
213,KingFerouk,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This review is in reference to ISBN 1-59330-200-2. Published by Aventine Press.Many changes were made from the original text to stay ""with the times"" but replacing words and leaving out certain phrases from what the author intended just doesn't go well with me. Not only that but the text is so close to the binding that you have to bend the book in order to read it comfortably. The original version is best. check out these versions instead. ISBN 0879804440 which is a Facsimile edition, or ISBN 9781585426591"
214,James,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The content was the same as any other version they have of this book. The layout was bad in this version though. The paragraphs sometimes appeared or of nowhere and made it very hard to understand.The only reason why this didn't get 1 star was because the book had the audio books of the chapters at the end. I haven't listened to them yet, but it can't be much worse than the book format."
215,Daspmp79,,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought thins book expecting more than a hours of info that in the end really didn't help me in the slightest bit.

218,Kindle Customer,,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Motivational speaker's textbook, with the key words all in caps as if shouting them at the reader would make them more clear or some such.  Propaganda at its most obvious."

0,shubham kanbajia,Disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I ordered this Bulb when I was ordering alexa echo dot because Amazon was showing the bundle pack of echo dot and wipro smart bulb.As soon as I received this smart bulb I did all the required configuration, however the bulb was working fine alone with its application. But it didn't get paired with the echo dot.I called the alexa customer care they Also helped me regarding the pairing of both the devices but they couldn't find it.Finally the customer care ordered the new bulb saying that this bulb is having some issues regarding pairing and all.Yesterday I received the new bulb, but I am again facing the same problem.So my experience for this bulb regarding alexa integration is very bad. And now I am gonna try different brand smart bulb for Alexa integration."

3,Akhilesh,Wipro smart bulb is so smart that this janam won't be enough to experience that,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  There's nothing to like about this product, it's too dull and you can only pray to God for it to start working like for most of things we have to pray to work in india.A typical indian product as usual a half hearted attempt, I don't know when my country will start producing ^meets expectations ^ type products if not world class.There app is just pathetic, this app will remind you about the era 15 years back when using them was like entering a stupid puzzle challenge.Apps too slow and you never know whether it will ever connect, its just like black hole, you open it and you get sucked into it and will have no idea on whats on the other side or what s gonna happen.This is not expected from an IT company.Please don't make such thaka hua products, better to increase the cost and give a mind blowing product than this good for nothing types.If this device gets connected via wifi, forget trying to connect it to alexa walexa or Bluetooth.Just thank God and distribute some prasadham."
4,pratul,Medium-low quality product.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not  functioning  properly. It  has  some  drawbacks - I  use it with my  wi-fi. If  I  close/shut off my wi-fi - the bulb becomes  defunt- I have to  re-set it  again .  You have  to be  near  the bulb to set it  every time.  The  very purpose  of purchasing  the  bub is  defeated.Hence, not satisfied."
5,Amazon Customer,Average product with little to no packaging,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  An average product. You'll need atleast two of them to light up your room appropriately, even if the room is small. The smart features are good. But I'm really disappointed with the packaging. No bubble wrap, no tape, nothing. I'm fortunate enough that it's working. However, there might be internal damage which may affect the life. Expected better from Wipro."
6,Amazon Customer,Smart or Ordinary,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  This was worst delivery package I had ever had by amazon. Wipro Smart bulb which I received is working but not showing to connect on smartphone. In package it says when turn on bulb blink rapidly, what I saw is not blinking looks like a ordinary bulb to me. I have tried many times but it’s not working as company said. Maybe it’s fake or not working. I checked this bulb on local store nearby they say it’s not working as a smart bulb. I was so stupid to buy this bulb on amazon. I have learned that never buy this kind of smart bulb or Other small accessories from Amazon And  I will recommend to everyone not to buy this kind of product from amazon.Thank youBe careful and Think twice before you buy."
7,Vineeth Chandran,Limited use,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Brightness is very low on any colour mode. I miss that this light cannot give 'warn white' color. Bright enough only on white mode. Very frequently lamp goes into a flickering mode making it useless. Tried resetting for no use.
8,Varun Kumar,Buy Halonix Prizm over this for same price,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  But Halonix Prizm over this. Brightness in color mode is low and also colors are dull in this bulb. Halonix prizm has brighter colors and also more saturated and defined colors. Apps and functionality for both are exactly same. However, Halonix is 12w for same price and much brighter in color mode. Wipro seems more like a night bulb."
9,Abir Basak,"Poor experience, yoo many glitches",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The fundamental problem with this light is that it doesn't remember state. Thus if power comes back, it turns on in broad daylight.The second problem, frequent disconnection from network. So one have to repeat the command to Alexa/home a few times.The third problem, the wipro app is too buggy. Fortunately, smartlife app works."
10,Amazon Customer,Buy this from a store rather than amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I barely used this bulb for 20 days and the white light flickered and now it went off. Its dark completely. Amazon just offers 10 day replacement. if u get this from a nearby store u can at least get a years warranty on this. The bulb as a whole is good. the build, the alexa integration, the wipro app as well. For me currently only the colours work well. However i use white light most of the time. Spending approx Rs.900 for just 20 days is waste. So trust me even if its cheap on amazon, u rather get it from a store."
11,Sahil Shah,Average Product. Not value for money.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is average... I am not sure about other products in similar category but the item that I got is not very impressive for the amount of money that it costs... it claims to emit a wide range of colors but is not actually able to produce all the colors displayed. Additionally the light automatically shuts down after some time automatically... not sure if this is a regular case or defective product that I have received. And definately there is a lot of lag in the color changing time.
12,Rakesh Bidadi,Non reliability,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this Smart light in March 2019. It was working fine for 4 to 5 months but after that now there is an issue with the light. White mode doesn’t turn on from app. Color mode is ok. I have done the resetting procedure n number of times but still the problem persist. Very disappointed.
13,prateek,Totally not worth it.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Not easy to install as compared to other products in market. App side, UI/UX is very poor. App works slow while changing the colour. Don’t go for it. I’m returning mine as well. Mansaa’s product and UX is far better than this. I’ve been using Mansaa’s smart sunshine bulb for 3yrs now. It still is faster than this Wipro’s smart bulb."
14,Jeevan Choudhary,Facing challenge in replacement of this item within its warrenty period.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  Product worked fine, but didn't last long. Stopped working in 10 months. It comes with 2 yrs warrrenty, but  there is no email/phone contact for the seller Cloudtail India. So difficult to get it replaced as Amazon customer service does not have details for its seller. Looking for Amazon to help on this matter."
15,Amazon Customer,Unable to connect in Amazon Alexa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I have tried all possible options, but unfortunately Alexa app unable to discover those devices (I had purchased 2 light).Also no vendor support received neither from Wipro nor Amazon.So planning to return back Alexa and Wipro Smart 12W bulbs."
16,manish,Not as expected,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  I used it for 3-4 days then returned it. If you are planning to use it for a room/hall then don't go for it. Its good only for a night lamp other than that not much useful. I have pointed my experience below:1 .Brightness very less, not sufficient for a normal bedroom, that too in 9W.2. If there is a power cut, light won't stay in last state, it will go into the ON state that's very annoying.3.Although it was near to my wifi router still I could see low signal in app.(but it doesn't affect the performance much)."
17,SudhirV,I won't recommend u.. used item delivered.,2.0 out of 5 stars,  ☑️Used product sent to me.. sold by Cloudtail India Pvt ltd✔️I got it for 799/-⚠️It needs Wipro app n this installed app needs to save WiFi network(WiFi router) then only it operates bulb⚠️This app does not connect directly with bulb by using our smartphones WiFi network/hotspot so don't be confused⚠️ I won't recommend u.. it's headache..

19,Suraj,Waste Of Money,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  In case power goes off, and then resumes, this light will be ON always. Irrespective of the previous ON/OFF status using mobile app or Echo. This means when you are not at home, and power goes off and comes again, this light will be glowing all the time until you come back and manually switch off !! Waste of money"
20,Rovinson,Not useful,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  You need extra WiFi connection excluding mobile hotspot or net connection to control this bulb, we can't control this bulb by our mobile without additional WiFi device,so useless, always needs internet connectivity to control device,"
21,Meenakshi ,Dint like,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Though light is good as it is 7 wt bulb.. but connecting to device takes a lot of time amd patience. I got irritated to connect it... It requires a lot a spair time and patience to play with it..Useless for me.. hence i returned.
22,Alex,2 star,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The problem with this bulb is that it keeps forgetting the colour it should stay on, after using it around 10 times it turned back to white and then we have to reconnect it to the phone and change the colour."
23,N30,Power wastage,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It does not retain previous state. There is no setting to configure last state. After power failure the bulb will be in ON state wasting energy. Maybe a firmware update can fix it. Other features are good.
24,Vikash S.,Waste product,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Not easy to installDon't buy the product as it's waste & nonconnecting with my wifi even....I wasted money & time completely..
25,Arpita Kundu,Wipro smart led - not satisfied,2.0 out of 5 stars,"   Bulb flickers at random during change in color. The transition of colors is smooth but all of a sudden there is a flicker with dark color.Also wifi needs to be a bit more powerful.Sorry, video could not be uploaded."
26,Pandey,Lacks music sync,2.0 out of 5 stars,  It misses the music sync feature that are there in most of the other bulbs....so purchase this only if you don't want that...I hope that this feature could be provided in this bulb by adding feature of music sync or music mode in the app...
27,Archana,difficult to connect once switched off from switchboard,2.0 out of 5 stars,  The light is gud...but the wifi signal is very poor...if i switched off the light and again want to connect it wth the phone one pop comes that signal is very poor...first time it works perfactly but if u switched off it in the switch board...then i could not able connect it...hence i m returning it..
28,Tech point,color lights are too dim,2.0 out of 5 stars,  Cons*Wi-Fi connectivity range is short.*Cool white ~ Natural white ~warm white have good brightness but the rest colors are too dim (not excepting from a 12W light)Pros*It can be easily connected with a few minutes (for the fist time) later you can easily access in no time (real time access).

31,Amazon Customer,Worst product,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I bought this bulb from Cloudtail through Amazon. The bulb got fused within 3 monthsSince this has a warranty I approached Cloudtail for replacement. They never responded even after many reminders. Even Amazon has not come to my help. Finally I had to throw the bulb and keep quiet..
32,A Customer,Low brightness and not practical,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  It is impractical. There should be a simple way to switch ON when there is no wifi, can't expect to switch on from phone everytime. Also the brightness is too low. Extremely expensive for the wattage. Better to buy a wifi power plug and use a normal bulb."
33,mandala,Username is not valid,2.0 out of 5 stars,  I am unable to link Wipro app with Alexa... the wipro link page keeps saying username is incorrect although its the correct one.

36,Mandar W.,"except white, no other color shines as expected",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  functionally all is well with this light. Only when we turn it to colors except for white, the light feels way less than what a standard 7W LED shall be able to project. when in white, its good for 7W LED. Apart from light, connectivity, Wipro App etc everything is good."
37,yash,Alexa Integration,2.0 out of 5 stars,  More than 50 percent times the light doesn't identify itself from the name it has been saved from.
